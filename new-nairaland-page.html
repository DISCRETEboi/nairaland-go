    Do you have a story of the most embarrassing thing that fell out of your pocket/bag? <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"><br><br>I remembered some time ago when I went to get some groceries at the mall. I forgot I bought groundnut earlier before I got to the mall. I kept it in my pocket and went ahead to get my stuff. After picking the items I needed. I went straight to the cashier's desk and joined the queue.  If you see the hot chicks that were behind me, even the cashier wasn’t left out in this contest of beauty. Omo, I was already thinking after paying for my groceries I’ll wait a little bit and make advances on any of them. <br><br>It got to my turn to pay. The cashier calculated my items and told me the price of what I bought. She asked me if I was paying with cash or a card. <br>I told her cash preferably. My right hand reached for my pocket. The moment I dipped my hand in, I withdrew the money and the groundnut escaped from the side and fell on the floor. The cellophane got burst and the groundnut sprawled in different directions. <br>I was just looking at the #50 groundnut littering the place I stood. The girls at my back saw the groundnut come out of my pocket and couldn't help but giggle. The cashier was just looking at me in a puzzled way as she extend her hand to receive the money for what I bought. <br>What got me embarrassed was when one lady who was struggling her way to the front queue said, “How fine boy go shook groundnut for pocket dey chop am like small pikin?” <br>I couldn't say anything, that day I wished everything could come to an end quickly because my ego has been dealt with and the motivation to approach turned zero. <br>I had to hurry and take my stuff out before they finish me with their hypocritical look. <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces">  <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"><br><br><br>There are more embarrassing experiences I had but I would like to hear from the house of NL what embarrassing thing has fell out of their pocket/bag <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/wink.png" alt="wink" border="0" class="faces">

I have just noticed recently that most girls I meet will suddenly want to “settle”. <br/><br/>You would wonder why this should be a problem right? Exactly. I am looking to getting into something serious myself so it should ordinarily not be a bad thing. However, I am seeing a pattern which is why I am worried. <br/><br/>I have met quite a few girls recently and many of them who are obviously still very active players on the ’street’ and as soon as we get talking, they suddenly want to exit the ‘street’ and want something serious with me. <br/><br/>For context, I will be 27years old in a few months, comfortably building a good career and a very calm person. It is not even about money or sort as many of them have met people with much more. I don’t know if any guy or lady out here actually understand my situation here? <br/><br/>I am looking to go into something serious but this pattern just doesn’t look all okay with me. Is it because of my calm nature? Maybe a calm guy is suitable for a husband kind of situation right? <br/><br/>For guys who have been in this situation, how did you dealt with it please?</div><img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"></div>

We really can&#39;t blame them cos they have a biological time clock and once they don&#39;t settle down in their 20s, it may become an issue for them.<br/><br/><b>Regardless, open your eyes and never date or marry any woman out of pressure or pity! Look out for the right character traits like honesty, hard work and morals. <br/><br/>Take note that girls pretend a lot and you may never know their real character unless you start as platonic friends.</b></div><img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"></div>

You remind me of myself a few years back. The only advice I will give you is forget about women focus on your life.. When u get to certain age if you dont have money no one will look at you. If I had somebody to give me this advice at your age my life would be much better.. Right now the only thing I have to show for in life is my 2 year old beautiful daughter.. I can&#39;t count the number of girls that where flocking around me back then, there was a time I had 9 girlfriends, the money and time I should have used to build my future all wasted.. Today I&#39;m reaping what I sewed.. So my guy be wise.</div><img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"></div>
