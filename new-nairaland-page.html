And I also survived 2 mass layoffs. <br/><br/>None of those experiences felt good.  When I was let go the first time, I panicked because I had no savings. <br/><br/>I spent 3 months unemployed. <br/> <br/>The second time, I had savings and spent 5 months unemployed. But I survived both times and actually moved into better roles. <br/><br/>Today, I’m grateful that I had those experience even though I was devastated in those moments. <br/><br/>They pushed me to the next level in my career each time. To everyone being affected by layoffs, please take the time to breathe. <br/><br/>Evaluate what you really want out of your next opportunity. <br/><br/>And keep your head up. <br/><br/>Something better is coming!</div></div>

We saw it in 2020 with the hospitality sector and a bunch of others.<br/><br/>Career pivot or not, there are many, many stories of people who were laid off and eventually found their way to something much, much better.</div></div>

    <div style="line-height:20px;white-space: pre-wrap;" class="comment-text"><div class="narrow">Unfortunately fortunate have been laid off 6 times in the last 10 years (not fired, downsized or &#34;consilidated&#34;. Yes 6 times and some of these young whipper snapper recruiters or hiring managers are clueless of the hard times in mid to late 90&#39;s and of course from 2000 to 2010. I&#39;ve gained a massive amount of knowledge from working with great companies and I&#39;d put my experience up against anyone. Those being laid off, remember what you&#39;ve learned from where you&#39;ve been and articulate how you can be of benefit to whoever is looking at you. If they question or even hesitate your work history, move on as there are those experienced hiring managers out there that salivate knowing experience matters....</div></div>

    <div style="line-height:20px;white-space: pre-wrap;" class="comment-text"><div class="narrow">I find it so powerful when people share their past experiences and seeming failures. It uplifts and helps people in similar positions know no failure is final, if you don’t accept it as final. Felt good to read this. I got made redundant from a job I loved, absolutely broke me and my saving. I felt let down and lied to by the management, but on the positive I’m now in full time employment and starting to progress. �<br/><br/>I got let go 4 months ago as my leadership position was eliminated. First time it ever happened to me but I&#39;m actually thankful it did. I was stuck in a super toxic culture and I was afraid to move on because of the situation the last two years. <br/><br/>Taking the last few months to reflect has taught me that I was suffering from anxiety and depression. Who knows how long it would have gone on if I was still working there. I&#39;ve learned more through this experience than any other in my life and I&#39;m looking forward to what comes next. Thank you for posting this today. I needed it!</div></div>

I cried cos I had no option to sort money . I left ijebu .. but later the issues was resolved but I was already back to school .. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Also while working for a local pharmaceutical company, I had problem with the new supervisor, he sacked me..<br/><br/>To my surprise other workers stopped working that day and protested against the man. The issues escalated and they call our oga for Lagos , Honestly I was loved by many at work back then..  I was called back the following week but I already left ibadan .. <br/> Beginning of this year, I saw the supervisor working at one private school ( I passed the place ), I greeted him like an old friends and honestly I was not holding any grudges against him again . Although I was stubborn, humorous  and  hardworking at factory back then .. I give am tough time . Lol <br/><br/><br/>These were my two experiences.</div></div>

    <div style="line-height:20px;white-space: pre-wrap;" class="comment-text"><div class="narrow">It&#39;s nice of you to be vulnerable enough to share your experience with us and give people an opportunity to share theirs too. Fam, being laid off after getting used to getting steady income is tragic especially if it came at a time when you were not expecting all that.<br/><br/>We are human beings and the first thing is to feel sad and sulk about it. But after that, you need to pick your self up and make a decision on what&#39;s next. It&#39;s either time to start looking for another job, or learning a new skill that is relevant to your next move, or whatever else.<br/><br/>The most pressing question on the mind of a newly laid off person is where will money come from? This can be a scary period, but if you can use it well it can be the most life changing period of a person&#39;s life.<br/><br/>Why not start a business? you might ask with which money but you can literally do dropshipping. Where you make money from selling wholesalers products without stocking them. <br/><br/>There are websites like <a rel="ugc" href="https://www.gotahia.com">www.gotahia.com</a> where you can get access the latest product updates from wholesalers in major markets like trade fair, lagos island, mandilas, computer village, etc for free. <br/><br/>With the time you have on your hands and the zeal you have to make money, you can channel it to getting customers for these products. The thing with starting with Gotahia is that you also have access to sales classes which are hosted by sales coaches sometimes. <br/><br/>It&#39;s sad to get laid off, but you can definitely  see it as an opportunity to start making money of your own. Visit <a rel="ugc" href="https://www.gotahia.com/reseller">www.gotahia.com/reseller</a> to get started</div></div>

You really despise those areas and underrate Gbagada! <br/>In Oworo or Bariga alone, two bedroom is like N800k p/a on the aeverage. In Gbagada, a roomself is around 350-400k while a two bedroom is 1m upward per annum. Do your research well.</div></div>

Missing parts of me. And I wasn’t prepared for that loss.<br/><br/>But, are we ever prepared for ANY loss?<br/><br/>It is human (and foolish) of us to claim anything as ours. We clench to and protect things, people, whatever with supreme fear of losing them when in reality we know deep inside that nothing ever belongs to us. Even the air we breathe is borrowed. Our children are borrowed. The time we spend here on earth is borrowed.<br/><br/>Life has a way of reminding us of this truth to keep us humble, and grateful. <br/><br/>So here I am. Grateful and humbled. I’m here to remind you that everything around you is a gift. Enjoy it as long as it lasts. Never take it for granted. <br/><br/>And when the time comes to let go of it, don’t hold tight. Simply open your heart, mind and hands and release it with grace and gratitude that it was once under your care.<br/><br/>It is only when you release what was that you are able to receive what will be.</div></div>

    <div style="line-height:20px;white-space: pre-wrap;" class="comment-text"><div class="narrow">I am an NCE holder. I finished my NCE programme 2018,I started working as a security operative immediately I graduated from school till last month. I resigned last month due to several reasons: 1. The salary is meagre compared to the stress I am subjected to 2. Security work is risky: one can get jailed for a crime one knows nothing about, a security guard is the number one target of armed robbers during  their operations. 3. One is deprived of night&#39;s sleep for 1week. 4.security work is synonymous to humiliation; a security guard is commonly seen as someone who has no bearing in life, a nonentity and a hopeless person. 4.  I find it difficult to communicate eloquently in English Language because most of my colleagues are not learned. We converse in Hausa and pidgin.                                                         <br/>  I need a job with good prospect, like Teaching or any job that can improve my communication skills. Within the short period of time that I have been jobless I have received 3 security job offers  which I rejected. I have resolved not to work as a security guard again and I don&#39;t want to go against it. Please I need your advice. Pardon my grammatical and mechanical errors</div></div>

    <div style="line-height:20px;white-space: pre-wrap;" class="comment-text"><div class="narrow">Mine is long.<br/>I started my career as a sales rep with one the biggest feed companies in the country, located in Jos. I studied Animal Health Technology. My sales was doing well until the company decided to produce a low budget layer feed for people who could not afford the regular feed. The quality so poor that it made farmers abandon the brand because the feed gave very poor egg production. My sales nose-dived. The company was looking for a scapegoat, and fingers were pointed at me, blaming me for incompetence in managing customers and farmers to continue using what is killing their farms. For that reason,that they no longer need my service. As they were preparing my sack letter, I resigned. I had no savings cos I was building my house. I stayed home for 3 months, those months were hell. On the 4th Month, I got a job with a popular hatchery in Oyo state, to be their sales rep in Katsina and Zamfara. I was to market 2 products. Chicks and feed. When I started, sales there was zero. I raised the sales of day-old-chicks by over 20% while that of feed was not possible because the company had already soiled its reputation with lack of production, which caused unavailability of feed. The GM Sales phoned me one afternoon, shouting on me, saying I am lazy and I don&#39;t work, that all I do is to be sleeping everyday there in Katsina, that they are giving me 1 week, if I don&#39;t come up with sales of feed I will be sacked. Guess what? 2 days later, I resigned. I stayed home for one year no job, it wasn&#39;t as hellish as the last joblessness though, cos I had moved into my house and went to crop farming. In 2021, I got an offer with a Lagos company to be their sales rep in Abuja, the pay was good, but just like the last job, they stopped production for almost a year and customers have gone to other brands, sales was also zero, I was expected to revive sales. I am good at that. I resumed late July. But the problem was that before I got a depot for the company in Abuja so that products will be shipped from Lagos for Abuja customers, it took me more than a month. It wasn&#39;t even a fault of mine. It was due to the very sluggish due process they applied before approving money for the depot&#39;s rent. I started sales in September, convincing customers to come back was not joke, but by December, sales was above 30% of my target. Just when I was getting ready to go for introduction, to get married, boom! A letter hit my mail that if I don&#39;t get 100% sales, I will be laid off. Baba, naso e happen. I was laid off February this year, 2022. The company no just get patience, just when sales was beginning to rise, that&#39;s when they cut me down. So if you know any company in the veterinary/livestock industry hiring, I am available. I can cover any where for them as far as it is in the North, even if it is Maiduguri, 0802. 760. 6363.</div></div>

I decided to stop last two months because of the massive inflation and how in the space of 5years ,I have only gotten an increment of 30k despite the massive increase in work load and  the visible growth of the organisation. CEO enjoys drives luxury cars and goes on vacation, meanwhile as an employee you struggle to even feed, talk more of transport,buy cloths,still have small savings. Oh did I mention that the working hours was from 8am to 6pm every day and Saturdays and public holidays for 9am to 3pm. Working for any private organization without any structure especially a one man business is hell on earth. For now I am not looking forward to work again, just my small side hustles and look out for better opportunities. Life no too hard,na people dey make life hard.</div></div>

    <div style="line-height:20px;white-space: pre-wrap;" class="comment-text"><div class="narrow">I graduated since 2017. Till now, no job. Sometime last year, I went for IRATA training and offshore rigger training in port harcourt and got certified. Yet, no job was forthcoming. After sometime, I started seeing the jobs but couldn’t apply because I needed some other documents to qualify me for offshore travel. These documents (BOISET, medical clearance and OSP)cost a lot of money and I didn’t have it anywhere. As God will have it, my relations favored me with the money without first asking for it from them. I quickly processed those documents and had everything ready by March this year. Brethren, since I got the documents complete till now, I haven’t seen any job to work with it and it’s making me depressed. It’s not a funny’s situation at all. How I got the money to do all these was just favor from God. Everything cost more than a million naira. I have debt of almost 700k to settle but here I am at home jobless!!!!</div></div>

    <div style="line-height:20px;white-space: pre-wrap;" class="comment-text"><div class="narrow">I worked with the whole of my heart for an organization as a temporary staff, hoping that I will be retained. It was an state owned institution in the North, before then, I was told that the institution hardly employs non-indigene or non-Muslims, and there was gender-bias too, but I kept pushing. Fast forward to some months later, there was a strike and the department that I worked for in the institution could not pay me anymore. <br/><br/>I had to leave and go back to continue job hunting. It was not easy, I came across alot of terrible thoughts and feelings. It takes a strong heart and the grace of God to survive it. I have a job now and I am grateful to God for it. At the right time, things will work out, the lesson I learnt from those unemployed period is to be patient, even though its not easy.<br/><br/>I wish all job seekers a successful job offer.</div></div>

    <div style="line-height:20px;white-space: pre-wrap;" class="comment-text"><div class="narrow">Just when I was feeling down about my unemployment situation and wondering why landing a job is being so difficult for me , I stumble upon this thread. <br/><br/>Reading through have been consoling and I really hope everyone going through this phase comes out of it victorious. It&#39;s a really hard place to be. <br/><br/>Many times I just feel useless and tell myself that maybe I&#39;m not doing enough to secure a job. The financial mess is the worse, not being able to meet your needs is the worse that can happen to anyone. <br/><br/>I&#39;ve been taking courses to improve myself while I keep applying and waiting, will be rounding up one of the courses this week.. but honestly I don&#39;t know what motivates me to keep taking these courses cos most times I&#39;m super down and just want to stop but I guess my love for learning new things is the reason I just keep at it. I really can&#39;t wait to start working again. <br/><br/>To the op and all the contributors to this thread thanks for sharing.</div></div>

Sometimes I feel like going crazy. <br/>Imagine with my little job taking care of the family with 2 kids. Hmm I am really tired <br/>He is a graduate, studied urban and regional planning, good in interiors and knows how to draw. <br/>Any body led by the spirit of God should help a sister..

I initially got a job as a credit officer in a microfinance bank, omooo i won diee for that work cos i didn&#39;t know it entails me walking around the whole state just to get customers to take loan and if i didn&#39;t meet stipulated target, my salary might get delayed. 2 month into the job, i had already had  to resign cos of the hazard the job posed, imagine a young guy like me harassing a 70yr old men &amp; women cos of default, it even got to the point I had accident  but God saved me shaa, naso i leave the work ooo. 5 months later after sapa nearly killed me, i got another job in a Medical Lab working as a laboratory officer, i worked there for 6 months and i had to resign this month cos the pay was small and my employer wasn&#39;t ready to increase it, imagine graduate collecting 20K monthly ooo <img src="/faces/huh.png" style="width:15px;height:22px;"/>, i enjoyed the job just that the money can&#39;t solve anything at all, i had to accept the job cos i didn&#39;t wanted to sit at home doing nothing but the pay was too small...Now I&#39;m currently searching for job, i have a BSc in Microbiology and i don&#39;t mind working anywhere as far as the pay is okay...my Phone number is 07043010958. <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/smiley.png" alt="smiley" border="0" class="faces"/></blockquote><br/>You shouldn&#39;t have resigned from the lab job. Because it is relevant to your career prospects which if you have garnered much experience you can open yours or work in a bigger firm.</div></div>

    <div style="line-height:20px;white-space: pre-wrap;" class="comment-text"><div class="narrow">I&#39;m a fresh graduate of Architecture from the University, awaiting service, I also have ND in same discipline.<br/>In the last 5 years, while still a student, I had started and run a small business- production and sales of neckties (Business ties and bowties) and other fashion accessories. It was a big challenge running the business while studying Architecture (those who studied architecture can relate) but since the business was financing my academics, I struggled to keep up until in my penultimate year, when I had to put the business aside to concentrate on my studies. <br/>Upon graduation, I went back to business, but it became very difficult because I had lost a lot of clients when I was away. I managed to get back a major client who buys in bulk, but the patronage wasn&#39;t consistent. <br/>While working to get the business back on track, I decided to take the Google data analytics course, my PC broke down just after I completed the course, as such it became quite difficult to practice what I had learned to be better at it, build a portfolio and be employment ready. <br/>A week later, I saw a job opening for a data role, I took a leap of faith cos I had no experience, and applied for the job. I was invited for an excel based test, which I passed, sailed through to the last stage of the recruitment process, discussed salary and all, but was later dropped on the grounds that I do not have NYSC discharge certificate. I was devastated, cos I needed that job badly, business wasn&#39;t working, laptop was bad, hustling became tougher, and I was dead broke.<br/><br/>It&#39;s been many months of being broke and job hunting, nothing yet, still pushing, and hoping for the best. Sapa don touch Me reach bone, but we ain&#39;t giving up here.</div></div>
