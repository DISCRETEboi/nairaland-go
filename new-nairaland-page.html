    <div style="line-height:20px;white-space: pre-wrap;" class="comment-text"><div class="narrow">Tech is honestly the best industry to get into right now. The opportunities are numerous. Almost every job vacancy out there is tech this tech that, developer this and developer that. I stayed in school for 4 years studying for a useless engineering degree and I have never in my life seen a vacancy for the rubbish I studied but there are tech roles every day. But in spite of so many jobs in tech, a lot of new developers struggle to get opportunities. I started being active in the tech community recently and I am meeting developers who have been coding for 5 to 7 years but have never had an opportunity. Talking with them has led me to discover that it&#39;s actually not the tech industry but a few of the reasons I am listing below.<br/><br/>1. You follow the trends: A lot of us developers love to focus on the sexy trendy stuff. Newsflash, what is sexy and trendy isn&#39;t used and even when used is used by very few companies. So millions of people who have struggled to learn the sexy stuff are all going to fight for those few roles out there. Take for example the latest coolest CSS framework tailwind. It&#39;s really cool and hyped up and it&#39;s like the go-to framework right now but the thing is in the industry people are still using bootstrap. People are learning tailwind but they don&#39;t know the number one CSS framework out there. Just because something is cool and sexy doesn&#39;t mean that everyone is going to switch to it overnight. <br/><br/>If you give junior developers a chance between Angular, React, and Vue. A lot of people are going to pick Vue. They will say it&#39;s sexy and cool and has a ton of GitHub stars. There are jobs using Vue but they are so few compared to React and Angular that you would be pigeonholing yourself by learning that. Theres a whole of difference between coding for fun and coding to get a job.<br/><br/>2. You have unrealistic expectations: This is something I usually see on Reddit cscareerquestions but it seems to becoming a norm amongst everybody. People believe that if your salary isnt starting at 100k USD a year or you dont work for a tech company, you arent a developer. Its so elitist and unfortunately a lot of developers in Nigeria are beginning to have this mindset. They learn HTML, CSS, JS. They have built absolutely no projects but because someone said you need the knowledge of DSA to get a job they immediately start grinding leetcode day and night with the hope of getting into Google. You learnt to code from a Udemy course and you really want to compete at DSAs with people who went to MIT. People who have been doing competitive programming since 5 years old. People who get gold medals at the international olympaids of informatics like its nothing.  <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"/> <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"/> <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"/>. Funny enough, I also had this mindset when I was learning to code but corrected myself later on. The truth is that not every tech job out there tests with DSA or needs knowledge of DSA and not everybody must work for a big tech company. This reasoning is so flawed. It is like saying every lawyer must work for law firms like wale olanipekun and co or every engineer must work for exxonmobil. There are a ton of jobs that will pay you well as a junior developer like really well and you need not struggle to get them. They wont test you with DSA. They would only look at the complexities of your projects and go through them with you. By well paid I am talking of 500k and above. Ask yourself how many people asking you to do DSA in Nigeria have not yet worked at Google. There are even whatsapp groups dedicated to DSA and if you cant solve one you are kicked out. The person giving you DSA is not working at Google or Facebook hmm give yourself a brain o.<br/><br/><br/>3. You do not know how to cut off the bullshit from social media: There&#39;s so much information out there today but if you don&#39;t know how to cut off the bullshit from what you need, you would waste your time. A lot of influencers and creators are putting information out there for themselves. They follow the algorithms and put out what is going to give them the most value in terms of money for their time. If I put out WordPress content, nobody will watch it but if I go out there and make MERN stack tutorials I would be getting millions of views but to be truthful you do not need the MERN stack as a junior. No one is using MongoDB in prod. Very few websites use Nodejs. You are just limiting yourself with that. If you want to be a full stack developer look at things like C# and Java springboot. Those pay really really well and there are even certifications you can acquire in those frameworks that can help get you opportunities at enterprise companies that use them especially if you don&#39;t have a computer science degree.<br/><br/>4 Your projects are not worth paying for:  People put out calculators, todo lists, tictactoe games and a lot of bullshit on their portfolio and wonder why they aren&#39;t getting interviews. You have applied for 100 jobs and haven&#39;t been called back and you absolutely do not know the reason why. Nobody is going to hire you with a to-do list and a calculator on your portfolio. Even if you get an interview, is a calculator something you are going to show your interviewer. What happened to making a social media application, a chat application, a blog, an analytic tool, a dashboard. Something that people actually use in the real world every day. I remember one of the first interviews I have, one of my projects was a payment application I used paystacks API for. Everything was done with HTML, CSS and Javascript and once my interviewer saw the project and the button I used to connect the API, he made an offer to me immediately. Your projects matter especially as a beginner. One solid project is better than 100 garbage projects.<br/><br/>5 You don&#39;t research: Honestly, in this tech thing, I take what everyone is saying as bullshit. The senior developer I work with an Australian guy was telling me to learn web assembly if I really want to get a job with visa sponsorship which I so desperately need. I am tired of remote especially doing it from this shithole zoo of a country. I went to Linkedin Jobs and various countries indeed websites and I couldn&#39;t even see up to 500 jobs total in web assembly. Why would I waste time learning something that has no jobs because it might be relevant in ten years. Nodejs came out in 2009 and it is still not relevant in 2021. What is the probability that web assembly will be relevant in 2031. Research. When people tell you to learn a technology. Go to linkedinjobs and indeed and check how many jobs exist for that technology worldwide. People always advise you from their own point of view but the point of view of a senior developer in America, Europe or Australia is not the same for you a junior developer in the world&#39;s poverty capital.<br/><br/>Tech pays provided you do it right men.</div></div>

    <div style="line-height:20px;white-space: pre-wrap;" class="comment-text"><div class="narrow"><blockquote><a href="/post/99249885"><b>tensazangetsu20</b></a>:<br/>Tech is honestly the best industry to get into right now. The opportunities are numerous. Almost every job vacancy out there is tech this tech that, developer this and developer that. I stayed in school for 4 years studying for a useless engineering degree and I have never in my life seen a vacancy for the rubbish I studied but there are tech roles every day. But in spite of so many jobs in tech, a lot of new developers struggle to get opportunities. I started being active in the tech community recently and I am meeting developers who have been coding for 5 to 7 years but have never had an opportunity. Talking with them has led me to discover that it&#39;s actually not the tech industry but a few of the reasons I am listing below.<br/><br/>1. You follow the trends: A lot of us developers love to focus on the sexy trendy stuff. Newsflash, what is sexy and trendy isn&#39;t used and even when used is used by very few companies. So millions of people who have struggled to learn the sexy stuff are all going to fight for those few roles out there. Take for example the latest coolest CSS framework tailwind. It&#39;s really cool and hyped up and it&#39;s like the go-to framework right now but the thing is in the industry people are still using bootstrap. People are learning tailwind but they don&#39;t know the number one CSS framework out there. Just because something is cool and sexy doesn&#39;t mean that everyone is going to switch to it overnight. <br/><br/>If you give junior developers a chance between Angular, React, and Vue. A lot of people are going to pick Vue. They will say it&#39;s sexy and cool and has a ton of GitHub stars. There are jobs using Vue but they are so few compared to React and Angular that you would be pigeonholing yourself by learning that. Theres a whole of difference between coding for fun and coding to get a job.<br/><br/>2. You have unrealistic expectations: This is something I usually see on Reddit cscareerquestions but it seems to becoming a norm amongst everybody. People believe that if your salary isnt starting at 100k USD a year or you dont work for a tech company, you arent a developer. Its so elitist and unfortunately a lot of developers in Nigeria are beginning to have this mindset. They learn HTML, CSS, JS. They have built absolutely no projects but because someone said you need the knowledge of DSA to get a job they immediately start grinding leetcode day and night with the hope of getting into Google. You learnt to code from a Udemy course and you really want to compete at DSAs with people who went to MIT. People who have been doing competitive programming since 5 years old. People who get gold medals at the international olympaids of informatics like its nothing.  <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"/> <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"/> <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"/>. Funny enough, I also had this mindset when I was learning to code but corrected myself later on. The truth is that not every tech job out there tests with DSA or needs knowledge of DSA and not everybody must work for a big tech company. This reasoning is so flawed. It is like saying every lawyer must work for law firms like wale olanipekun and co or every engineer must work for exxonmobil. There are a ton of jobs that will pay you well as a junior developer like really well and you need not struggle to get them. They wont test you with DSA. They would only look at the complexities of your projects and go through them with you. By well paid I am talking of 500k and above. Ask yourself how many people asking you to do DSA in Nigeria have not yet worked at Google. There are even whatsapp groups dedicated to DSA and if you cant solve one you are kicked out. The person giving you DSA is not working at Google or Facebook hmm give yourself a brain o.<br/><br/><br/>3. You do not know how to cut off the bullshit from social media: There&#39;s so much information out there today but if you don&#39;t know how to cut off the bullshit from what you need, you would waste your time. A lot of influencers and creators are putting information out there for themselves. They follow the algorithms and put out what is going to give them the most value in terms of money for their time. If I put out WordPress content, nobody will watch it but if I go out there and make MERN stack tutorials I would be getting millions of views but to be truthful you do not need the MERN stack as a junior. No one is using MongoDB in prod. Very few websites use Nodejs. You are just limiting yourself with that. If you want to be a full stack developer look at things like C# and Java springboot. Those pay really really well and there are even certifications you can acquire in those frameworks that can help get you opportunities at enterprise companies that use them especially if you don&#39;t have a computer science degree.<br/><br/>4 Your projects are not worth paying for:  People put out calculators, todo lists, tictactoe games and a lot of bullshit on their portfolio and wonder why they aren&#39;t getting interviews. You have applied for 100 jobs and haven&#39;t been called back and you absolutely do not know the reason why. Nobody is going to hire you with a to-do list and a calculator on your portfolio. Even if you get an interview, is a calculator something you are going to show your interviewer. What happened to making a social media application, a chat application, a blog, an analytic tool, a dashboard. Something that people actually use in the real world every day. I remember one of the first interviews I have, one of my projects was a payment application I used paystacks API for. Everything was done with HTML, CSS and Javascript and once my interviewer saw the project and the button I used to connect the API, he made an offer to me immediately. Your projects matter especially as a beginner. One solid project is better than 100 garbage projects.<br/><br/>5 You don&#39;t research: Honestly, in this tech thing, I take what everyone is saying as bullshit. The senior developer I work with an Australian guy was telling me to learn web assembly if I really want to get a job with visa sponsorship which I so desperately need. I am tired of remote especially doing it from this shithole zoo of a country. I went to Linkedin Jobs and various countries indeed websites and I couldn&#39;t even see up to 500 jobs total in web assembly. Why would I waste time learning something that has no jobs because it might be relevant in ten years. Nodejs came out in 2009 and it is still not relevant in 2021. What is the probability that web assembly will be relevant in 2031. Research. When people tell you to learn a technology. Go to linkedinjobs and indeed and check how many jobs exist for that technology worldwide. People always advise you from their own point of view but the point of view of a senior developer in America, Europe or Australia is not the same for you a junior developer in the world&#39;s poverty capital.<br/><br/>Tech pays provided you do it right men. </blockquote><br/>Boss your posts are always informative and eye opening.<br/><br/>Am learning to be a front end developer.

Javascript running in nodejs environment  is constantly one of them.The figures of PHP are largely misleading, because most sites on the internet are powered by word press, which uses PHP under the hood. The thing is, most of these sites are shitty sites with serious security issues,built by charlatans. There are several remote job opportunities for nodejs developers abroad, however, anyone that wants a race to the bottom price dragging with Indians on Freelancer.com and other freelancing sites, should stick to only PHP. PHP on its own is not a bad language, but it is prone to abuse by bad developers. However, for anyone that wants to focus on the Nigeria market alone, PHP is a better bet in terms of job opportunities.The thing is, nodejs will keep growing, albeit, gradually, because there are tones of sites already built with PHP before node came along, and they will need to be maintained. However, because of the ease of transition from using javascript only on front-end to using at the back-end, which node offers, more people will still use node going forward. Check the yearly developers survey on stackoverflow, and see where the industry is tilting to, also check stackoverflow jobs, and see tons of nodejs jobs advertised daily. My advice generally remains, know about 2 back-end languages.</div></div>

PHP for startups and medium sized companies and java for enterprise level companies. The same thing you say about Nodejs is what I got told about but there&#39;s so few node jobs out there. It&#39;s just hyped up. And PHP isn&#39;t relevant because of wordpress. There&#39;s other platforms built with PHP which are very complicated and aren&#39;t known by a lot of Devs but they are widely used. Theres Moodle, there&#39;s Magento. The list is endless. Those platforms are why PHP is the major backend for the web. Most of the top universities in the world have their websites powered up by Moodle. I haven&#39;t started learning PHP and working with wordpress and jamstack sites for up to three months and the difference in my life is clear. I am still a junior developer with less than one year experience but I am on my third remote job and recently just got another offer. So I work for two companies presently with less than one year experience. One of them is even a well funded startup in California. I am building out the whole website in wordpress and React. Their major product is not on their website so the backend is powered by WordPress.</div></div>

I recommend PHP and java to people. PHP for startups and medium sized companies and java for enterprise level companies. The same thing you say about Nodejs is what I got told about but there&#39;s so few node jobs out there. It&#39;s just hyped up. And PHP isn&#39;t relevant because of wordpress. There&#39;s other platforms built with PHP which are very complicated and aren&#39;t known by a lot of Devs but they are widely used. Theres Moodle, there&#39;s Magento. The list is endless. Those platforms are why PHP is the major backend for the web. Most of the top universities in the world have their websites powered up by Moodle. I haven&#39;t started learning PHP and working with wordpress and jamstack sites for up to three months and the difference in my life is clear. I am still a junior developer with less than one year experience but I am on my third remote job and recently just got another offer.

I see myself more as an intermediate, mainly because I prefer to downplay my skills as a self critique in order to keep improving. I know people I am better than that refer to themselves as seniors. Anyways, all the seniors in this field I respect say DSA is important.Your approach may put money in your pocket faster, but on the long run, it may not look to be the best approach after all. I will only drop this one advice. This fella below. Tim Mensch, is one of the top senior programmers that answers questions  on quora,follow him, and you will learn a lot. I forgot to add a point. Nodejs that you deride so much has the biggest package manager in the world (npm), yet nodejs is one of the youngest back-end languages out there.</div></div>

I have no interest in general software development again except for my own personal projects or future startups. For me it&#39;s strictly just going to be Salesforce and jamstack. Even if I wanted to work at Google as a salesforce Developer, I won&#39;t be bombarded with those difficult algorithmic questions given to general Devs and the pay with general Devs is still the same thing.<br/><br/>But even at that general Devs at smaller companies and businesses do not get DSA at Interviews.</div></div>

NPM being the largest code repo proofs being a junior in such environments with so many devs is a waste of time if you are in Africa and trying to make a living. I hate been compared to some in UK or USA, of course life is easier there but here u got to use your head. How do you even becomes a mid level dev when u have never gotten a job in your stack.<br/><br/>You guys have probably been in the game for a while and have built connections, gotten jobs, gigs in the past. it is easy to say learn Node.js. But remember that the lockdown produced millions of junior self taught devs, Youtube tech channels is the proof for this.<br/><br/>Summary:<br/>If : you want to over train yourself before you get your first gig jumping from one projects, open source stuffs, tools etc. - choose Node.js or what not<br/>else : Choose a small niche with plenty opportunities and lesser competitions not necessary wordpress, odoo et al</div></div>

The animations are too much. You rushed through the whole thing. You also learnt c# for six months no project. Learn JavaScript pick a JavaScript Framework then learn PHP and wordpress deeply. I am not talking about the drag and drop part of wordpress o. The coding aspect and don&#39;t build sites from.your head. If you can&#39;t pay a designer take popular sites that look beautiful and remake them.</div></div>

The opportunities are numerous. Almost every job vacancy out there is tech this tech that, developer this and developer that. I stayed in school for 4 years studying for a useless engineering degree and I have never in my life seen a vacancy for the rubbish I studied but there are tech roles every day. But in spite of so many jobs in tech, a lot of new developers struggle to get opportunities. I started being active in the tech community recently and I am meeting developers who have been coding for 5 to 7 years but have never had an opportunity. Talking with them has led me to discover that it&#39;s actually not the tech industry but a few of the reasons I am listing below.<br/><br/>1. You follow the trends: A lot of us developers love to focus on the sexy trendy stuff. Newsflash, what is sexy and trendy isn&#39;t used and even when used is used by very few companies. So millions of people who have struggled to learn the sexy stuff are all going to fight for those few roles out there. Take for example the latest coolest CSS framework tailwind. It&#39;s really cool and hyped up and it&#39;s like the go-to framework right now but the thing is in the industry people are still using bootstrap. People are learning tailwind but they don&#39;t know the number one CSS framework out there. Just because something is cool and sexy doesn&#39;t mean that everyone is going to switch to it overnight. <br/><br/>If you give junior developers a chance between Angular, React, and Vue. A lot of people are going to pick Vue. They will say it&#39;s sexy and cool and has a ton of GitHub stars. There are jobs using Vue but they are so few compared to React and Angular that you would be pigeonholing yourself by learning that. Theres a whole of difference between coding for fun and coding to get a job.<br/><br/>2. You have unrealistic expectations: This is something I usually see on Reddit cscareerquestions but it seems to becoming a norm amongst everybody. People believe that if your salary isnt starting at 100k USD a year or you dont work for a tech company, you arent a developer. Its so elitist and unfortunately a lot of developers in Nigeria are beginning to have this mindset. They learn HTML, CSS, JS. They have built absolutely no projects but because someone said you need the knowledge of DSA to get a job they immediately start grinding leetcode day and night with the hope of getting into Google. You learnt to code from a Udemy course and you really want to compete at DSAs with people who went to MIT. People who have been doing competitive programming since 5 years old. People who get gold medals at the international olympaids of informatics like its nothing.  <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"/> <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"/> <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"/>. Funny enough, I also had this mindset when I was learning to code but corrected myself later on. The truth is that not every tech job out there tests with DSA or needs knowledge of DSA and not everybody must work for a big tech company. This reasoning is so flawed. It is like saying every lawyer must work for law firms like wale olanipekun and co or every engineer must work for exxonmobil. There are a ton of jobs that will pay you well as a junior developer like really well and you need not struggle to get them. They wont test you with DSA. They would only look at the complexities of your projects and go through them with you. By well paid I am talking of 500k and above. Ask yourself how many people asking you to do DSA in Nigeria have not yet worked at Google. There are even whatsapp groups dedicated to DSA and if you cant solve one you are kicked out. The person giving you DSA is not working at Google or Facebook hmm give yourself a brain o.<br/><br/><br/>3. You do not know how to cut off the bullshit from social media: There&#39;s so much information out there today but if you don&#39;t know how to cut off the bullshit from what you need, you would waste your time. A lot of influencers and creators are putting information out there for themselves. They follow the algorithms and put out what is going to give them the most value in terms of money for their time. If I put out WordPress content, nobody will watch it but if I go out there and make MERN stack tutorials I would be getting millions of views but to be truthful you do not need the MERN stack as a junior. No one is using MongoDB in prod. Very few websites use Nodejs. You are just limiting yourself with that. If you want to be a full stack developer look at things like C# and Java springboot. Those pay really really well and there are even certifications you can acquire in those frameworks that can help get you opportunities at enterprise companies that use them especially if you don&#39;t have a computer science degree.<br/><br/>4 Your projects are not worth paying for:  People put out calculators, todo lists, tictactoe games and a lot of bullshit on their portfolio and wonder why they aren&#39;t getting interviews. You have applied for 100 jobs and haven&#39;t been called back and you absolutely do not know the reason why. Nobody is going to hire you with a to-do list and a calculator on your portfolio. Even if you get an interview, is a calculator something you are going to show your interviewer. What happened to making a social media application, a chat application, a blog, an analytic tool, a dashboard. Something that people actually use in the real world every day. I remember one of the first interviews I have, one of my projects was a payment application I used paystacks API for. Everything was done with HTML, CSS and Javascript and once my interviewer saw the project and the button I used to connect the API, he made an offer to me immediately.

    <div style="line-height:20px;white-space: pre-wrap;" class="comment-text"><div class="narrow"><blockquote><a href="/post/99249885"><b>tensazangetsu20</b></a>:<br/>Tech is honestly the best industry to get into right now. The opportunities are numerous. Almost every job vacancy out there is tech this tech that, developer this and developer that. I stayed in school for 4 years studying for a useless engineering degree and I have never in my life seen a vacancy for the rubbish I studied but there are tech roles every day. But in spite of so many jobs in tech, a lot of new developers struggle to get opportunities. I started being active in the tech community recently and I am meeting developers who have been coding for 5 to 7 years but have never had an opportunity. Talking with them has led me to discover that it&#39;s actually not the tech industry but a few of the reasons I am listing below.<br/><br/>1. You follow the trends: A lot of us developers love to focus on the sexy trendy stuff. Newsflash, what is sexy and trendy isn&#39;t used and even when used is used by very few companies. So millions of people who have struggled to learn the sexy stuff are all going to fight for those few roles out there. Take for example the latest coolest CSS framework tailwind. It&#39;s really cool and hyped up and it&#39;s like the go-to framework right now but the thing is in the industry people are still using bootstrap. People are learning tailwind but they don&#39;t know the number one CSS framework out there. Just because something is cool and sexy doesn&#39;t mean that everyone is going to switch to it overnight. <br/><br/>If you give junior developers a chance between Angular, React, and Vue. A lot of people are going to pick Vue. They will say it&#39;s sexy and cool and has a ton of GitHub stars. There are jobs using Vue but they are so few compared to React and Angular that you would be pigeonholing yourself by learning that. Theres a whole of difference between coding for fun and coding to get a job.<br/><br/>2. You have unrealistic expectations: This is something I usually see on Reddit cscareerquestions but it seems to becoming a norm amongst everybody. People believe that if your salary isnt starting at 100k USD a year or you dont work for a tech company, you arent a developer. Its so elitist and unfortunately a lot of developers in Nigeria are beginning to have this mindset. They learn HTML, CSS, JS. They have built absolutely no projects but because someone said you need the knowledge of DSA to get a job they immediately start grinding leetcode day and night with the hope of getting into Google. You learnt to code from a Udemy course and you really want to compete at DSAs with people who went to MIT. People who have been doing competitive programming since 5 years old. People who get gold medals at the international olympaids of informatics like its nothing.  <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"/> <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"/> <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"/>. Funny enough, I also had this mindset when I was learning to code but corrected myself later on. The truth is that not every tech job out there tests with DSA or needs knowledge of DSA and not everybody must work for a big tech company. This reasoning is so flawed. It is like saying every lawyer must work for law firms like wale olanipekun and co or every engineer must work for exxonmobil. There are a ton of jobs that will pay you well as a junior developer like really well and you need not struggle to get them. They wont test you with DSA. They would only look at the complexities of your projects and go through them with you. By well paid I am talking of 500k and above. Ask yourself how many people asking you to do DSA in Nigeria have not yet worked at Google. There are even whatsapp groups dedicated to DSA and if you cant solve one you are kicked out. The person giving you DSA is not working at Google or Facebook hmm give yourself a brain o.<br/><br/><br/>3. You do not know how to cut off the bullshit from social media: There&#39;s so much information out there today but if you don&#39;t know how to cut off the bullshit from what you need, you would waste your time. A lot of influencers and creators are putting information out there for themselves. They follow the algorithms and put out what is going to give them the most value in terms of money for their time. If I put out WordPress content, nobody will watch it but if I go out there and make MERN stack tutorials I would be getting millions of views but to be truthful you do not need the MERN stack as a junior. No one is using MongoDB in prod. Very few websites use Nodejs. You are just limiting yourself with that. If you want to be a full stack developer look at things like C# and Java springboot. Those pay really really well and there are even certifications you can acquire in those frameworks that can help get you opportunities at enterprise companies that use them especially if you don&#39;t have a computer science degree.<br/><br/>4 Your projects are not worth paying for:  People put out calculators, todo lists, tictactoe games and a lot of bullshit on their portfolio and wonder why they aren&#39;t getting interviews. You have applied for 100 jobs and haven&#39;t been called back and you absolutely do not know the reason why. Nobody is going to hire you with a to-do list and a calculator on your portfolio. Even if you get an interview, is a calculator something you are going to show your interviewer. What happened to making a social media application, a chat application, a blog, an analytic tool, a dashboard. Something that people actually use in the real world every day. I remember one of the first interviews I have, one of my projects was a payment application I used paystacks API for. Everything was done with HTML, CSS and Javascript and once my interviewer saw the project and the button I used to connect the API, he made an offer to me immediately. Your projects matter especially as a beginner. One solid project is better than 100 garbage projects.<br/><br/>5 You don&#39;t research: Honestly, in this tech thing, I take what everyone is saying as bullshit. The senior developer I work with an Australian guy was telling me to learn web assembly if I really want to get a job with visa sponsorship which I so desperately need. I am tired of remote especially doing it from this shithole zoo of a country.

Talking about data structures and algorithm, they are very important and if you likely get an interview in any top companies abroad you will likely flop as most questions are on DSA, that&#39;s why Nigerians with this mentality are the ones who write buggy code, have zero knowledge of memory management. When you do things that anyone with proper programming knowledge can go on YouTube and watch and implement in his project, then you come up here and write trash. from your description, your core skills are frontend based, go and so focus on it, infact 80% of people that call themselves developers in this country are frontend and they feel so high. I have met programmers who write code and not markup language, who program hardware and build crazy hardware, those who perform advance research on Ai and they don&#39;t talk ignorantly. So learn to know that you have lots of stuff to learn</div></div>

    <div style="line-height:20px;white-space: pre-wrap;" class="comment-text"><div class="narrow">Juniors be weary of people like that idiot. It&#39;s how he advised someone on an older thread to go and learn C++. So many people are learning to code now and you have to be strategic to get returns from it. Don&#39;t go and learn what you will be unemployed for 4 years. Time is worst thing to waste in this world. They call themselves senior. Who made them senior? <br/><br/>Hunger and poverty no send anybody o and in Nigeria you are already disadvantaged from the get go. I am still a junior like many in this section and my goal from day one has been to help other juniors with what has worked for me.</div></div>

Seriously. Me that had built my own CMS as a toy project. Like I said again, I am so glad I don&#39;t work with people like you. Review garbage codes for your other garbage developers.</div></div>

See how you are just embarassing yourself here. I can get 246 users for a tech product with a well planned google campaign. I ran a business and E commerce and I was doing more in revenue than what you are doing now and I didn&#39;t even know one line of code. Thats rubbish men.<br/><br/>Your product is garbage. Who is going to use it over the free alternatives that exist but even the final product that comes out of it is also garbage. In the era of solid amazing no code tools who&#39;s going to use enshelf. Let&#39;s come back in 2 years and know how many users you have na today?.</div></div>

You see you are very stupid. I said it will fail. Who&#39;s going to use your product over the other alternatives that exist? What advantage does your product have over others? This are the questions incubators asked but you went ahead praying for my parents to die and then asking for a LinkedIn profile of someone who hasn&#39;t even been working for up to six months to use and measure the size of your balls. Your andela colleagues will be very ashamed of you. Very ashamed.</div></div>

    <div style="line-height:20px;white-space: pre-wrap;" class="comment-text"><div class="narrow"><blockquote><a href="/post/99249885"><b>tensazangetsu20</b></a>:<br/>Tech is honestly the best industry to get into right now. The opportunities are numerous. Almost every job vacancy out there is tech this tech that, developer this and developer that. I stayed in school for 4 years studying for a useless engineering degree and I have never in my life seen a vacancy for the rubbish I studied but there are tech roles every day. But in spite of so many jobs in tech, a lot of new developers struggle to get opportunities. I started being active in the tech community recently and I am meeting developers who have been coding for 5 to 7 years but have never had an opportunity. Talking with them has led me to discover that it&#39;s actually not the tech industry but a few of the reasons I am listing below.<br/><br/>1. You follow the trends: A lot of us developers love to focus on the sexy trendy stuff. Newsflash, what is sexy and trendy isn&#39;t used and even when used is used by very few companies. So millions of people who have struggled to learn the sexy stuff are all going to fight for those few roles out there. Take for example the latest coolest CSS framework tailwind. It&#39;s really cool and hyped up and it&#39;s like the go-to framework right now but the thing is in the industry people are still using bootstrap. People are learning tailwind but they don&#39;t know the number one CSS framework out there. Just because something is cool and sexy doesn&#39;t mean that everyone is going to switch to it overnight. <br/><br/>If you give junior developers a chance between Angular, React, and Vue. A lot of people are going to pick Vue. They will say it&#39;s sexy and cool and has a ton of GitHub stars. There are jobs using Vue but they are so few compared to React and Angular that you would be pigeonholing yourself by learning that. Theres a whole of difference between coding for fun and coding to get a job.<br/><br/>2. You have unrealistic expectations: This is something I usually see on Reddit cscareerquestions but it seems to becoming a norm amongst everybody. People believe that if your salary isnt starting at 100k USD a year or you dont work for a tech company, you arent a developer. Its so elitist and unfortunately a lot of developers in Nigeria are beginning to have this mindset. They learn HTML, CSS, JS. They have built absolutely no projects but because someone said you need the knowledge of DSA to get a job they immediately start grinding leetcode day and night with the hope of getting into Google. You learnt to code from a Udemy course and you really want to compete at DSAs with people who went to MIT. People who have been doing competitive programming since 5 years old. People who get gold medals at the international olympaids of informatics like its nothing.  <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"/> <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"/> <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"/>. Funny enough, I also had this mindset when I was learning to code but corrected myself later on. The truth is that not every tech job out there tests with DSA or needs knowledge of DSA and not everybody must work for a big tech company. This reasoning is so flawed. It is like saying every lawyer must work for law firms like wale olanipekun and co or every engineer must work for exxonmobil. There are a ton of jobs that will pay you well as a junior developer like really well and you need not struggle to get them. They wont test you with DSA. They would only look at the complexities of your projects and go through them with you. By well paid I am talking of 500k and above. Ask yourself how many people asking you to do DSA in Nigeria have not yet worked at Google. There are even whatsapp groups dedicated to DSA and if you cant solve one you are kicked out. The person giving you DSA is not working at Google or Facebook hmm give yourself a brain o.<br/><br/><br/>3. You do not know how to cut off the bullshit from social media: There&#39;s so much information out there today but if you don&#39;t know how to cut off the bullshit from what you need, you would waste your time. A lot of influencers and creators are putting information out there for themselves. They follow the algorithms and put out what is going to give them the most value in terms of money for their time. If I put out WordPress content, nobody will watch it but if I go out there and make MERN stack tutorials I would be getting millions of views but to be truthful you do not need the MERN stack as a junior. No one is using MongoDB in prod. Very few websites use Nodejs. You are just limiting yourself with that. If you want to be a full stack developer look at things like C# and Java springboot. Those pay really really well and there are even certifications you can acquire in those frameworks that can help get you opportunities at enterprise companies that use them especially if you don&#39;t have a computer science degree.<br/><br/>4 Your projects are not worth paying for:  People put out calculators, todo lists, tictactoe games and a lot of bullshit on their portfolio and wonder why they aren&#39;t getting interviews. You have applied for 100 jobs and haven&#39;t been called back and you absolutely do not know the reason why. Nobody is going to hire you with a to-do list and a calculator on your portfolio. Even if you get an interview, is a calculator something you are going to show your interviewer. What happened to making a social media application, a chat application, a blog, an analytic tool, a dashboard. Something that people actually use in the real world every day. I remember one of the first interviews I have, one of my projects was a payment application I used paystacks API for. Everything was done with HTML, CSS and Javascript and once my interviewer saw the project and the button I used to connect the API, he made an offer to me immediately. Your projects matter especially as a beginner. One solid project is better than 100 garbage projects.<br/><br/>5 You don&#39;t research: Honestly, in this tech thing, I take what everyone is saying as bullshit. The senior developer I work with an Australian guy was telling me to learn web assembly if I really want to get a job with visa sponsorship which I so desperately need. I am tired of remote especially doing it from this shithole zoo of a country. I went to Linkedin Jobs and various countries indeed websites and I couldn&#39;t even see up to 500 jobs total in web assembly. Why would I waste time learning something that has no jobs because it might be relevant in ten years. Nodejs came out in 2009 and it is still not relevant in 2021. What is the probability that web assembly will be relevant in 2031. Research. When people tell you to learn a technology. Go to linkedinjobs and indeed and check how many jobs exist for that technology worldwide. People always advise you from their own point of view but the point of view of a senior developer in America, Europe or Australia is not the same for you a junior developer in the world&#39;s poverty capital.<br/><br/>Tech pays provided you do it right men. </blockquote>You can&#39;t compare web assembly and nodejs, do you know how much stress it will lift of people in the nearby future, you should also have foresight my brother.</div></div>

Most top companies aren&#39;t building monolithic project anymore, microservices and Rest API is what you&#39;d see now. That&#39;s why it might be hard getting a job as full-stack developer compared to getting one for Backend or Frontend development. Bootstrap is not what the industry are still using.</div></div>

    <div style="line-height:20px;white-space: pre-wrap;" class="comment-text"><div class="narrow">Very good post. You absolutely nailed it. But disappointed you have to call where you from zoo. Not sure if you are part of ipob warriors but neverthelessyou seem knowledgeable. Working on a project that actually solve issue in Nigeria might land you a visa sponsor job cos employer want people that are creative not people that see issue and decide to do nothing buy just condemn everyday or give up. Just a word of advice.<br/><br/> <blockquote><a href="/post/99249885"><b>tensazangetsu20</b></a>:<br/>Tech is honestly the best industry to get into right now. The opportunities are numerous. Almost every job vacancy out there is tech this tech that, developer this and developer that. I stayed in school for 4 years studying for a useless engineering degree and I have never in my life seen a vacancy for the rubbish I studied but there are tech roles every day. But in spite of so many jobs in tech, a lot of new developers struggle to get opportunities. I started being active in the tech community recently and I am meeting developers who have been coding for 5 to 7 years but have never had an opportunity. Talking with them has led me to discover that it&#39;s actually not the tech industry but a few of the reasons I am listing below.<br/><br/>1. You follow the trends: A lot of us developers love to focus on the sexy trendy stuff. Newsflash, what is sexy and trendy isn&#39;t used and even when used is used by very few companies. So millions of people who have struggled to learn the sexy stuff are all going to fight for those few roles out there. Take for example the latest coolest CSS framework tailwind. It&#39;s really cool and hyped up and it&#39;s like the go-to framework right now but the thing is in the industry people are still using bootstrap. People are learning tailwind but they don&#39;t know the number one CSS framework out there. Just because something is cool and sexy doesn&#39;t mean that everyone is going to switch to it overnight. <br/><br/>If you give junior developers a chance between Angular, React, and Vue. A lot of people are going to pick Vue. They will say it&#39;s sexy and cool and has a ton of GitHub stars. There are jobs using Vue but they are so few compared to React and Angular that you would be pigeonholing yourself by learning that. Theres a whole of difference between coding for fun and coding to get a job.<br/><br/>2. You have unrealistic expectations: This is something I usually see on Reddit cscareerquestions but it seems to becoming a norm amongst everybody. People believe that if your salary isnt starting at 100k USD a year or you dont work for a tech company, you arent a developer. Its so elitist and unfortunately a lot of developers in Nigeria are beginning to have this mindset. They learn HTML, CSS, JS. They have built absolutely no projects but because someone said you need the knowledge of DSA to get a job they immediately start grinding leetcode day and night with the hope of getting into Google. You learnt to code from a Udemy course and you really want to compete at DSAs with people who went to MIT. People who have been doing competitive programming since 5 years old. People who get gold medals at the international olympaids of informatics like its nothing.  <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"/> <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"/> <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"/>. Funny enough, I also had this mindset when I was learning to code but corrected myself later on. The truth is that not every tech job out there tests with DSA or needs knowledge of DSA and not everybody must work for a big tech company. This reasoning is so flawed. It is like saying every lawyer must work for law firms like wale olanipekun and co or every engineer must work for exxonmobil. There are a ton of jobs that will pay you well as a junior developer like really well and you need not struggle to get them. They wont test you with DSA. They would only look at the complexities of your projects and go through them with you. By well paid I am talking of 500k and above. Ask yourself how many people asking you to do DSA in Nigeria have not yet worked at Google. There are even whatsapp groups dedicated to DSA and if you cant solve one you are kicked out. The person giving you DSA is not working at Google or Facebook hmm give yourself a brain o.<br/><br/><br/>3. You do not know how to cut off the bullshit from social media: There&#39;s so much information out there today but if you don&#39;t know how to cut off the bullshit from what you need, you would waste your time. A lot of influencers and creators are putting information out there for themselves. They follow the algorithms and put out what is going to give them the most value in terms of money for their time. If I put out WordPress content, nobody will watch it but if I go out there and make MERN stack tutorials I would be getting millions of views but to be truthful you do not need the MERN stack as a junior. No one is using MongoDB in prod. Very few websites use Nodejs. You are just limiting yourself with that. If you want to be a full stack developer look at things like C# and Java springboot. Those pay really really well and there are even certifications you can acquire in those frameworks that can help get you opportunities at enterprise companies that use them especially if you don&#39;t have a computer science degree.<br/><br/>4 Your projects are not worth paying for:  People put out calculators, todo lists, tictactoe games and a lot of bullshit on their portfolio and wonder why they aren&#39;t getting interviews. You have applied for 100 jobs and haven&#39;t been called back and you absolutely do not know the reason why. Nobody is going to hire you with a to-do list and a calculator on your portfolio. Even if you get an interview, is a calculator something you are going to show your interviewer. What happened to making a social media application, a chat application, a blog, an analytic tool, a dashboard. Something that people actually use in the real world every day. I remember one of the first interviews I have, one of my projects was a payment application I used paystacks API for. Everything was done with HTML, CSS and Javascript and once my interviewer saw the project and the button I used to connect the API, he made an offer to me immediately. Your projects matter especially as a beginner. One solid project is better than 100 garbage projects.<br/><br/>5 You don&#39;t research: Honestly, in this tech thing, I take what everyone is saying as bullshit. The senior developer I work with an Australian guy was telling me to learn web assembly if I really want to get a job with visa sponsorship which I so desperately need. I am tired of remote especially doing it from this shithole zoo of a country. I went to Linkedin Jobs and various countries indeed websites and I couldn&#39;t even see up to 500 jobs total in web assembly. Why would I waste time learning something that has no jobs because it might be relevant in ten years. Nodejs came out in 2009 and it is still not relevant in 2021. What is the probability that web assembly will be relevant in 2031. Research. When people tell you to learn a technology. Go to linkedinjobs and indeed and check how many jobs exist for that technology worldwide. People always advise you from their own point of view but the point of view of a senior developer in America, Europe or Australia is not the same for you a junior developer in the world&#39;s poverty capital.<br/><br/>Tech pays provided you do it right men. </blockquote></div></div>

    <div style="line-height:20px;white-space: pre-wrap;" class="comment-text"><div class="narrow"><blockquote><a href="/post/99249885"><b>tensazangetsu20</b></a>:<br/>Tech is honestly the best industry to get into right now. The opportunities are numerous. Almost every job vacancy out there is tech this tech that, developer this and developer that. I stayed in school for 4 years studying for a useless engineering degree and I have never in my life seen a vacancy for the rubbish I studied but there are tech roles every day. But in spite of so many jobs in tech, a lot of new developers struggle to get opportunities. I started being active in the tech community recently and I am meeting developers who have been coding for 5 to 7 years but have never had an opportunity. Talking with them has led me to discover that it&#39;s actually not the tech industry but a few of the reasons I am listing below.<br/><br/>1. You follow the trends: A lot of us developers love to focus on the sexy trendy stuff. Newsflash, what is sexy and trendy isn&#39;t used and even when used is used by very few companies. So millions of people who have struggled to learn the sexy stuff are all going to fight for those few roles out there. Take for example the latest coolest CSS framework tailwind. It&#39;s really cool and hyped up and it&#39;s like the go-to framework right now but the thing is in the industry people are still using bootstrap. People are learning tailwind but they don&#39;t know the number one CSS framework out there. Just because something is cool and sexy doesn&#39;t mean that everyone is going to switch to it overnight. <br/><br/>If you give junior developers a chance between Angular, React, and Vue. A lot of people are going to pick Vue. They will say it&#39;s sexy and cool and has a ton of GitHub stars. There are jobs using Vue but they are so few compared to React and Angular that you would be pigeonholing yourself by learning that. Theres a whole of difference between coding for fun and coding to get a job.<br/><br/>2. You have unrealistic expectations: This is something I usually see on Reddit cscareerquestions but it seems to becoming a norm amongst everybody. People believe that if your salary isnt starting at 100k USD a year or you dont work for a tech company, you arent a developer. Its so elitist and unfortunately a lot of developers in Nigeria are beginning to have this mindset. They learn HTML, CSS, JS. They have built absolutely no projects but because someone said you need the knowledge of DSA to get a job they immediately start grinding leetcode day and night with the hope of getting into Google. You learnt to code from a Udemy course and you really want to compete at DSAs with people who went to MIT. People who have been doing competitive programming since 5 years old. People who get gold medals at the international olympaids of informatics like its nothing.  <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"/> <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"/> <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"/>. Funny enough, I also had this mindset when I was learning to code but corrected myself later on. The truth is that not every tech job out there tests with DSA or needs knowledge of DSA and not everybody must work for a big tech company. This reasoning is so flawed. It is like saying every lawyer must work for law firms like wale olanipekun and co or every engineer must work for exxonmobil. There are a ton of jobs that will pay you well as a junior developer like really well and you need not struggle to get them. They wont test you with DSA. They would only look at the complexities of your projects and go through them with you. By well paid I am talking of 500k and above. Ask yourself how many people asking you to do DSA in Nigeria have not yet worked at Google. There are even whatsapp groups dedicated to DSA and if you cant solve one you are kicked out. The person giving you DSA is not working at Google or Facebook hmm give yourself a brain o.<br/><br/><br/>3. You do not know how to cut off the bullshit from social media: There&#39;s so much information out there today but if you don&#39;t know how to cut off the bullshit from what you need, you would waste your time. A lot of influencers and creators are putting information out there for themselves. They follow the algorithms and put out what is going to give them the most value in terms of money for their time. If I put out WordPress content, nobody will watch it but if I go out there and make MERN stack tutorials I would be getting millions of views but to be truthful you do not need the MERN stack as a junior. No one is using MongoDB in prod. Very few websites use Nodejs. You are just limiting yourself with that. If you want to be a full stack developer look at things like C# and Java springboot. Those pay really really well and there are even certifications you can acquire in those frameworks that can help get you opportunities at enterprise companies that use them especially if you don&#39;t have a computer science degree.<br/><br/>4 Your projects are not worth paying for:  People put out calculators, todo lists, tictactoe games and a lot of bullshit on their portfolio and wonder why they aren&#39;t getting interviews. You have applied for 100 jobs and haven&#39;t been called back and you absolutely do not know the reason why. Nobody is going to hire you with a to-do list and a calculator on your portfolio. Even if you get an interview, is a calculator something you are going to show your interviewer. What happened to making a social media application, a chat application, a blog, an analytic tool, a dashboard. Something that people actually use in the real world every day. I remember one of the first interviews I have, one of my projects was a payment application I used paystacks API for. Everything was done with HTML, CSS and Javascript and once my interviewer saw the project and the button I used to connect the API, he made an offer to me immediately. Your projects matter especially as a beginner. One solid project is better than 100 garbage projects.<br/><br/>5 You don&#39;t research: Honestly, in this tech thing, I take what everyone is saying as bullshit. The senior developer I work with an Australian guy was telling me to learn web assembly if I really want to get a job with visa sponsorship which I so desperately need. I am tired of remote especially doing it from this shithole zoo of a country. I went to Linkedin Jobs and various countries indeed websites and I couldn&#39;t even see up to 500 jobs total in web assembly. Why would I waste time learning something that has no jobs because it might be relevant in ten years. Nodejs came out in 2009 and it is still not relevant in 2021. What is the probability that web assembly will be relevant in 2031. Research. When people tell you to learn a technology. Go to linkedinjobs and indeed and check how many jobs exist for that technology worldwide. People always advise you from their own point of view but the point of view of a senior developer in America, Europe or Australia is not the same for you a junior developer in the world&#39;s poverty capital.<br/><br/>Tech pays provided you do it right men. </blockquote><br/>Stop condemning a certain technology. How could you come up with the idea that MERN STACK is nonsense. Who told u MongoDB isn&#39;t used in production. Have u gone through the statistics in stackoverflow and see the community of experienced developers using MERN STACK. That u don&#39;t make use of a certain technology doesn&#39;t mean there are no opportunities there for it. Useful projects are being developed using this technology and I am a proud of it. I like ur advice in general though but I have heavy exception at the fact that u are condemning MERN STACK. That u don&#39;t use it doesn&#39;t make it any less important...</div></div>

Am not saying you should solve nigeria problem, but contribute some solution to the problems. That is called thinking outside the box which is a good key to getting visa sponsor job. Let me tell you a secret, you might know more than most managers in your current job or the ones that will interview you in the future. What catches them most is your story as you already mention. There are many problems in Nigeria.

    <div style="line-height:20px;white-space: pre-wrap;" class="comment-text"><div class="narrow">1) Saying MongoDB isn&#39;t used in production is false and misleading<br/>2) Off the top of my head, Paystack and Buycoins were built with Nodejs. It&#39;s not a nothing language or a fad.<br/>3) The advice should be learn to program and not learn a language. Understanding the difference between learning to program and learning a programming language will take you far.<br/>4) The aim of side projects should be to learn, it doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s a calculator or a to-do list. Your should learn something or reinforce something you&#39;ve learnt before. The goal of a side project should be to learn not the project itself.<br/>5) At the end of the day, it doesn&#39;t matter what language you know, I&#39;ve gotten jobs in Java, Ruby, Scala, Go and Nodejs without ever knowing those languages because someone earlier told me about point number 3.<br/>6) An advice I would love to have been given when I started out is this, ensure your learning is focused. This is related to point number 4. As a junior dev before you start a side project ask yourself what am I trying to learn?<br/>Building a to-do list just to learn about promises in JavaScript is a good thing. Rebuilding that to-do list with MongoDB just to learn how MongoDB works is valid and good. When you start out, most companies want to know you can learn and are teachable so being able to explain what a promise is in JavaScript will get you a job faster than having a million side projects and not knowing the basics.<br/>7) If you ever have the opportunity to take a course in data structures and algorithms, do it. While you might never work in Google or Facebook, the knowledge would help you become a better developer.</div></div>

    <div style="line-height:20px;white-space: pre-wrap;" class="comment-text"><div class="narrow"><blockquote><a href="/post/99249885"><b>tensazangetsu20</b></a>:<br/>Tech is honestly the best industry to get into right now. The opportunities are numerous. Almost every job vacancy out there is tech this tech that, developer this and developer that. I stayed in school for 4 years studying for a useless engineering degree and I have never in my life seen a vacancy for the rubbish I studied but there are tech roles every day. But in spite of so many jobs in tech, a lot of new developers struggle to get opportunities. I started being active in the tech community recently and I am meeting developers who have been coding for 5 to 7 years but have never had an opportunity. Talking with them has led me to discover that it&#39;s actually not the tech industry but a few of the reasons I am listing below.<br/><br/>1. You follow the trends: A lot of us developers love to focus on the sexy trendy stuff. Newsflash, what is sexy and trendy isn&#39;t used and even when used is used by very few companies. So millions of people who have struggled to learn the sexy stuff are all going to fight for those few roles out there. Take for example the latest coolest CSS framework tailwind. It&#39;s really cool and hyped up and it&#39;s like the go-to framework right now but the thing is in the industry people are still using bootstrap. People are learning tailwind but they don&#39;t know the number one CSS framework out there. Just because something is cool and sexy doesn&#39;t mean that everyone is going to switch to it overnight. <br/><br/>If you give junior developers a chance between Angular, React, and Vue. A lot of people are going to pick Vue. They will say it&#39;s sexy and cool and has a ton of GitHub stars. There are jobs using Vue but they are so few compared to React and Angular that you would be pigeonholing yourself by learning that. Theres a whole of difference between coding for fun and coding to get a job.<br/><br/>2. You have unrealistic expectations: This is something I usually see on Reddit cscareerquestions but it seems to becoming a norm amongst everybody. People believe that if your salary isnt starting at 100k USD a year or you dont work for a tech company, you arent a developer. Its so elitist and unfortunately a lot of developers in Nigeria are beginning to have this mindset. They learn HTML, CSS, JS. They have built absolutely no projects but because someone said you need the knowledge of DSA to get a job they immediately start grinding leetcode day and night with the hope of getting into Google. You learnt to code from a Udemy course and you really want to compete at DSAs with people who went to MIT. People who have been doing competitive programming since 5 years old. People who get gold medals at the international olympaids of informatics like its nothing.  <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"/> <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"/> <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"/>. Funny enough, I also had this mindset when I was learning to code but corrected myself later on. The truth is that not every tech job out there tests with DSA or needs knowledge of DSA and not everybody must work for a big tech company. This reasoning is so flawed. It is like saying every lawyer must work for law firms like wale olanipekun and co or every engineer must work for exxonmobil. There are a ton of jobs that will pay you well as a junior developer like really well and you need not struggle to get them. They wont test you with DSA. They would only look at the complexities of your projects and go through them with you. By well paid I am talking of 500k and above. Ask yourself how many people asking you to do DSA in Nigeria have not yet worked at Google. There are even whatsapp groups dedicated to DSA and if you cant solve one you are kicked out. The person giving you DSA is not working at Google or Facebook hmm give yourself a brain o.<br/><br/><br/>3. You do not know how to cut off the bullshit from social media: There&#39;s so much information out there today but if you don&#39;t know how to cut off the bullshit from what you need, you would waste your time. A lot of influencers and creators are putting information out there for themselves. They follow the algorithms and put out what is going to give them the most value in terms of money for their time. If I put out WordPress content, nobody will watch it but if I go out there and make MERN stack tutorials I would be getting millions of views but to be truthful you do not need the MERN stack as a junior. No one is using MongoDB in prod. Very few websites use Nodejs. You are just limiting yourself with that. If you want to be a full stack developer look at things like C# and Java springboot. Those pay really really well and there are even certifications you can acquire in those frameworks that can help get you opportunities at enterprise companies that use them especially if you don&#39;t have a computer science degree.<br/><br/>4 Your projects are not worth paying for:  People put out calculators, todo lists, tictactoe games and a lot of bullshit on their portfolio and wonder why they aren&#39;t getting interviews. You have applied for 100 jobs and haven&#39;t been called back and you absolutely do not know the reason why. Nobody is going to hire you with a to-do list and a calculator on your portfolio. Even if you get an interview, is a calculator something you are going to show your interviewer. What happened to making a social media application, a chat application, a blog, an analytic tool, a dashboard. Something that people actually use in the real world every day. I remember one of the first interviews I have, one of my projects was a payment application I used paystacks API for. Everything was done with HTML, CSS and Javascript and once my interviewer saw the project and the button I used to connect the API, he made an offer to me immediately. Your projects matter especially as a beginner. One solid project is better than 100 garbage projects.<br/><br/>5 You don&#39;t research: Honestly, in this tech thing, I take what everyone is saying as bullshit. The senior developer I work with an Australian guy was telling me to learn web assembly if I really want to get a job with visa sponsorship which I so desperately need. I am tired of remote especially doing it from this shithole zoo of a country. I went to Linkedin Jobs and various countries indeed websites and I couldn&#39;t even see up to 500 jobs total in web assembly. Why would I waste time learning something that has no jobs because it might be relevant in ten years. Nodejs came out in 2009 and it is still not relevant in 2021. What is the probability that web assembly will be relevant in 2031. Research. When people tell you to learn a technology. Go to linkedinjobs and indeed and check how many jobs exist for that technology worldwide. People always advise you from their own point of view but the point of view of a senior developer in America, Europe or Australia is not the same for you a junior developer in the world&#39;s poverty capital.<br/><br/>Tech pays provided you do it right men. </blockquote><br/>Very interesting.

It&#39;s not a nothing language or a fad.<br/>3) The advice should be learn to program and not learn a language. Understanding the difference between learning to program and learning a programming language will take you far.<br/>4) The aim of side projects should be to learn, it doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s a calculator or a to-do list. Your should learn something or reinforce something you&#39;ve learnt before. The goal of a side project should be to learn not the project itself.<br/>5) At the end of the day, it doesn&#39;t matter what language you know, I&#39;ve gotten jobs in Java, Ruby, Scala, Go and Nodejs without ever knowing those languages because someone earlier told me about point number 3.<br/>6) An advice I would love to have been given when I started out is this, ensure your learning is focused. This is related to point number 4. As a junior dev before you start a side project ask yourself what am I trying to learn?<br/>Building a to-do list just to learn about promises in JavaScript is a good thing. Rebuilding that to-do list with MongoDB just to learn how MongoDB works is valid and good. When you start out, most companies want to know you can learn and are teachable so being able to explain what a promise is in JavaScript will get you a job faster than having a million side projects and not knowing the basics.<br/>7) If you ever have the opportunity to take a course in data structures and algorithms, do it. While you might never work in Google or Facebook, the knowledge would help you become a better developer. </blockquote>To do lists are useless projects in a portfolio, op was right about that. And the language is important biko programming is not music, I&#39;ve learnt that the hard way, you can&#39;t tell me that after someone finishes cracking his head with memory allocation, data structures and pointers in C that you&#39;ll just get a job out of thin air, programming is not an art, like I&#39;ve said before we are Nigerians.</div></div>

You follow the trends: A lot of us developers love to focus on the sexy trendy stuff. Newsflash, what is sexy and trendy isn&#39;t used and even when used is used by very few companies. So millions of people who have struggled to learn the sexy stuff are all going to fight for those few roles out there. Take for example the latest coolest CSS framework tailwind. It&#39;s really cool and hyped up and it&#39;s like the go-to framework right now but the thing is in the industry people are still using bootstrap. People are learning tailwind but they don&#39;t know the number one CSS framework out there. Just because something is cool and sexy doesn&#39;t mean that everyone is going to switch to it overnight. <br/><br/>If you give junior developers a chance between Angular, React, and Vue. A lot of people are going to pick Vue. They will say it&#39;s sexy and cool and has a ton of GitHub stars. There are jobs using Vue but they are so few compared to React and Angular that you would be pigeonholing yourself by learning that. Theres a whole of difference between coding for fun and coding to get a job.<br/><br/>2. You have unrealistic expectations: This is something I usually see on Reddit cscareerquestions but it seems to becoming a norm amongst everybody. People believe that if your salary isnt starting at 100k USD a year or you dont work for a tech company, you arent a developer. Its so elitist and unfortunately a lot of developers in Nigeria are beginning to have this mindset. They learn HTML, CSS, JS. They have built absolutely no projects but because someone said you need the knowledge of DSA to get a job they immediately start grinding leetcode day and night with the hope of getting into Google. You learnt to code from a Udemy course and you really want to compete at DSAs with people who went to MIT. People who have been doing competitive programming since 5 years old. People who get gold medals at the international olympaids of informatics like its nothing.  <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"/> <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"/> <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"/>. Funny enough, I also had this mindset when I was learning to code but corrected myself later on. The truth is that not every tech job out there tests with DSA or needs knowledge of DSA and not everybody must work for a big tech company. This reasoning is so flawed. It is like saying every lawyer must work for law firms like wale olanipekun and co or every engineer must work for exxonmobil. There are a ton of jobs that will pay you well as a junior developer like really well and you need not struggle to get them. They wont test you with DSA. They would only look at the complexities of your projects and go through them with you. By well paid I am talking of 500k and above. Ask yourself how many people asking you to do DSA in Nigeria have not yet worked at Google. There are even whatsapp groups dedicated to DSA and if you cant solve one you are kicked out. The person giving you DSA is not working at Google or Facebook hmm give yourself a brain o.<br/><br/><br/>3. You do not know how to cut off the bullshit from social media: There&#39;s so much information out there today but if you don&#39;t know how to cut off the bullshit from what you need, you would waste your time. A lot of influencers and creators are putting information out there for themselves. They follow the algorithms and put out what is going to give them the most value in terms of money for their time. If I put out WordPress content, nobody will watch it but if I go out there and make MERN stack tutorials I would be getting millions of views but to be truthful you do not need the MERN stack as a junior. No one is using MongoDB in prod. Very few websites use Nodejs. You are just limiting yourself with that. If you want to be a full stack developer look at things like C# and Java springboot. Those pay really really well and there are even certifications you can acquire in those frameworks that can help get you opportunities at enterprise companies that use them especially if you don&#39;t have a computer science degree.<br/><br/>4 Your projects are not worth paying for:  People put out calculators, todo lists, tictactoe games and a lot of bullshit on their portfolio and wonder why they aren&#39;t getting interviews. You have applied for 100 jobs and haven&#39;t been called back and you absolutely do not know the reason why. Nobody is going to hire you with a to-do list and a calculator on your portfolio. Even if you get an interview, is a calculator something you are going to show your interviewer. What happened to making a social media application, a chat application, a blog, an analytic tool, a dashboard. Something that people actually use in the real world every day. I remember one of the first interviews I have, one of my projects was a payment application I used paystacks API for. Everything was done with HTML, CSS and Javascript and once my interviewer saw the project and the button I used to connect the API, he made an offer to me immediately. Your projects matter especially as a beginner. One solid project is better than 100 garbage projects.<br/><br/>5 You don&#39;t research: Honestly, in this tech thing, I take what everyone is saying as bullshit. The senior developer I work with an Australian guy was telling me to learn web assembly if I really want to get a job with visa sponsorship which I so desperately need. I am tired of remote especially doing it from this shithole zoo of a country. I went to Linkedin Jobs and various countries indeed websites and I couldn&#39;t even see up to 500 jobs total in web assembly. Why would I waste time learning something that has no jobs because it might be relevant in ten years. Nodejs came out in 2009 and it is still not relevant in 2021. What is the probability that web assembly will be relevant in 2031. Research. When people tell you to learn a technology. Go to linkedinjobs and indeed and check how many jobs exist for that technology worldwide. People always advise you from their own point of view but the point of view of a senior developer in America, Europe or Australia is not the same for you a junior developer in the world&#39;s poverty capital.<br/><br/>Tech pays provided you do it right men. </blockquote> Please can i get your whatsapp contact too, i do need alot of advice sir</div></div>

    <div style="line-height:20px;white-space: pre-wrap;" class="comment-text"><div class="narrow">I don&#39;t know why people like to blindly follow BS trends. Believing everything every project is MERN, me i always use them to laugh sha because when the time comes to pay the technical debt I won&#39;t be there. <br/><br/>Mongo Db is just like javascript. At first you enjoy the dynamic typing then one day you find an integer value in a place where array should be. Schema less is tempting but one day a simple change will throw all your code into flames. <br/><br/>Hosting Mongo DB is also a pain. It is on many order of magnitude harder than it&#39;s sql counterparts. Many big companies are dumping it for Postgres self.<br/><br/>React is almost cool. But it is not opinionated and that is exactly it&#39;s weak point.<br/><br/>How will Node and express cope when you have thousands/millions of cpu intensive requests? MERN IMO is for small scale apps.<br/><br/><blockquote><a href="/post/99379839"><b>lushak</b></a>:<br/><br/><br/>Stop condemning a certain technology. How could you come up with the idea that MERN STACK is nonsense. Who told u MongoDB isn&#39;t used in production. Have u gone through the statistics in stackoverflow and see the community of experienced developers using MERN STACK. That u don&#39;t make use of a certain technology doesn&#39;t mean there are no opportunities there for it. Useful projects are being developed using this technology and I am a proud of it. I like ur advice in general though but I have heavy exception at the fact that u are condemning MERN STACK. That u don&#39;t use it doesn&#39;t make it any less important...</blockquote></div></div>

The opportunities are numerous. Almost every job vacancy out there is tech this tech that, developer this and developer that. I stayed in school for 4 years studying for a useless engineering degree and I have never in my life seen a vacancy for the rubbish I studied but there are tech roles every day. But in spite of so many jobs in tech, a lot of new developers struggle to get opportunities. I started being active in the tech community recently and I am meeting developers who have been coding for 5 to 7 years but have never had an opportunity. Talking with them has led me to discover that it&#39;s actually not the tech industry but a few of the reasons I am listing below.<br/><br/>1. You follow the trends: A lot of us developers love to focus on the sexy trendy stuff. Newsflash, what is sexy and trendy isn&#39;t used and even when used is used by very few companies. So millions of people who have struggled to learn the sexy stuff are all going to fight for those few roles out there. Take for example the latest coolest CSS framework tailwind. It&#39;s really cool and hyped up and it&#39;s like the go-to framework right now but the thing is in the industry people are still using bootstrap. People are learning tailwind but they don&#39;t know the number one CSS framework out there.

Funny enough, I also had this mindset when I was learning to code but corrected myself later on. The truth is that not every tech job out there tests with DSA or needs knowledge of DSA and not everybody must work for a big tech company. This reasoning is so flawed. It is like saying every lawyer must work for law firms like wale olanipekun and co or every engineer must work for exxonmobil. There are a ton of jobs that will pay you well as a junior developer like really well and you need not struggle to get them. They wont test you with DSA. They would only look at the complexities of your projects and go through them with you. By well paid I am talking of 500k and above. Ask yourself how many people asking you to do DSA in Nigeria have not yet worked at Google. There are even whatsapp groups dedicated to DSA and if you cant solve one you are kicked out. The person giving you DSA is not working at Google or Facebook hmm give yourself a brain o.<br/><br/><br/>3.

Go to linkedinjobs and indeed and check how many jobs exist for that technology worldwide. People always advise you from their own point of view but the point of view of a senior developer in America, Europe or Australia is not the same for you a junior developer in the world&#39;s poverty capital.<br/><br/>Tech pays provided you do it right men. </blockquote><br/>Where can I start from...I have zero knowledge in coding..</div></div>

It&#39;s not a nothing language or a fad.<br/>3) The advice should be learn to program and not learn a language. Understanding the difference between learning to program and learning a programming language will take you far.<br/>4) The aim of side projects should be to learn, it doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s a calculator or a to-do list. Your should learn something or reinforce something you&#39;ve learnt before. The goal of a side project should be to learn not the project itself.<br/>5) At the end of the day, it doesn&#39;t matter what language you know, I&#39;ve gotten jobs in Java, Ruby, Scala, Go and Nodejs without ever knowing those languages because someone earlier told me about point number 3.<br/>6) An advice I would love to have been given when I started out is this, ensure your learning is focused. This is related to point number 4. As a junior dev before you start a side project ask yourself what am I trying to learn?<br/>Building a to-do list just to learn about promises in JavaScript is a good thing. Rebuilding that to-do list with MongoDB just to learn how MongoDB works is valid and good. When you start out, most companies want to know you can learn and are teachable so being able to explain what a promise is in JavaScript will get you a job faster than having a million side projects and not knowing the basics.<br/>7) If you ever have the opportunity to take a course in data structures and algorithms, do it. While you might never work in Google or Facebook, the knowledge would help you become a better developer. </blockquote><br/>Great ADVICES!!!</div></div>

    <div style="line-height:20px;white-space: pre-wrap;" class="comment-text"><div class="narrow"><blockquote><a href="/post/99249885"><b>tensazangetsu20</b></a>:<br/>Tech is honestly the best industry to get into right now. The opportunities are numerous. Almost every job vacancy out there is tech this tech that, developer this and developer that. I stayed in school for 4 years studying for a useless engineering degree and I have never in my life seen a vacancy for the rubbish I studied but there are tech roles every day. But in spite of so many jobs in tech, a lot of new developers struggle to get opportunities. I started being active in the tech community recently and I am meeting developers who have been coding for 5 to 7 years but have never had an opportunity. Talking with them has led me to discover that it&#39;s actually not the tech industry but a few of the reasons I am listing below.<br/><br/>1. You follow the trends: A lot of us developers love to focus on the sexy trendy stuff. Newsflash, what is sexy and trendy isn&#39;t used and even when used is used by very few companies. So millions of people who have struggled to learn the sexy stuff are all going to fight for those few roles out there. Take for example the latest coolest CSS framework tailwind. It&#39;s really cool and hyped up and it&#39;s like the go-to framework right now but the thing is in the industry people are still using bootstrap. People are learning tailwind but they don&#39;t know the number one CSS framework out there. Just because something is cool and sexy doesn&#39;t mean that everyone is going to switch to it overnight. <br/><br/>If you give junior developers a chance between Angular, React, and Vue. A lot of people are going to pick Vue. They will say it&#39;s sexy and cool and has a ton of GitHub stars. There are jobs using Vue but they are so few compared to React and Angular that you would be pigeonholing yourself by learning that. Theres a whole of difference between coding for fun and coding to get a job.<br/><br/>2. You have unrealistic expectations: This is something I usually see on Reddit cscareerquestions but it seems to becoming a norm amongst everybody. People believe that if your salary isnt starting at 100k USD a year or you dont work for a tech company, you arent a developer. Its so elitist and unfortunately a lot of developers in Nigeria are beginning to have this mindset. They learn HTML, CSS, JS. They have built absolutely no projects but because someone said you need the knowledge of DSA to get a job they immediately start grinding leetcode day and night with the hope of getting into Google. You learnt to code from a Udemy course and you really want to compete at DSAs with people who went to MIT. People who have been doing competitive programming since 5 years old. People who get gold medals at the international olympaids of informatics like its nothing.  <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"/> <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"/> <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"/>. Funny enough, I also had this mindset when I was learning to code but corrected myself later on. The truth is that not every tech job out there tests with DSA or needs knowledge of DSA and not everybody must work for a big tech company. This reasoning is so flawed. It is like saying every lawyer must work for law firms like wale olanipekun and co or every engineer must work for exxonmobil. There are a ton of jobs that will pay you well as a junior developer like really well and you need not struggle to get them. They wont test you with DSA. They would only look at the complexities of your projects and go through them with you. By well paid I am talking of 500k and above. Ask yourself how many people asking you to do DSA in Nigeria have not yet worked at Google. There are even whatsapp groups dedicated to DSA and if you cant solve one you are kicked out. The person giving you DSA is not working at Google or Facebook hmm give yourself a brain o.<br/><br/><br/>3. You do not know how to cut off the bullshit from social media: There&#39;s so much information out there today but if you don&#39;t know how to cut off the bullshit from what you need, you would waste your time. A lot of influencers and creators are putting information out there for themselves. They follow the algorithms and put out what is going to give them the most value in terms of money for their time. If I put out WordPress content, nobody will watch it but if I go out there and make MERN stack tutorials I would be getting millions of views but to be truthful you do not need the MERN stack as a junior. No one is using MongoDB in prod. Very few websites use Nodejs. You are just limiting yourself with that. If you want to be a full stack developer look at things like C# and Java springboot. Those pay really really well and there are even certifications you can acquire in those frameworks that can help get you opportunities at enterprise companies that use them especially if you don&#39;t have a computer science degree.<br/><br/>4 Your projects are not worth paying for:  People put out calculators, todo lists, tictactoe games and a lot of bullshit on their portfolio and wonder why they aren&#39;t getting interviews. You have applied for 100 jobs and haven&#39;t been called back and you absolutely do not know the reason why. Nobody is going to hire you with a to-do list and a calculator on your portfolio. Even if you get an interview, is a calculator something you are going to show your interviewer. What happened to making a social media application, a chat application, a blog, an analytic tool, a dashboard. Something that people actually use in the real world every day. I remember one of the first interviews I have, one of my projects was a payment application I used paystacks API for. Everything was done with HTML, CSS and Javascript and once my interviewer saw the project and the button I used to connect the API, he made an offer to me immediately. Your projects matter especially as a beginner. One solid project is better than 100 garbage projects.<br/><br/>5 You don&#39;t research: Honestly, in this tech thing, I take what everyone is saying as bullshit. The senior developer I work with an Australian guy was telling me to learn web assembly if I really want to get a job with visa sponsorship which I so desperately need. I am tired of remote especially doing it from this shithole zoo of a country. I went to Linkedin Jobs and various countries indeed websites and I couldn&#39;t even see up to 500 jobs total in web assembly. Why would I waste time learning something that has no jobs because it might be relevant in ten years. Nodejs came out in 2009 and it is still not relevant in 2021. What is the probability that web assembly will be relevant in 2031. Research. When people tell you to learn a technology. Go to linkedinjobs and indeed and check how many jobs exist for that technology worldwide. People always advise you from their own point of view but the point of view of a senior developer in America, Europe or Australia is not the same for you a junior developer in the world&#39;s poverty capital.<br/><br/>Tech pays provided you do it right men. </blockquote><br/>Get out of Nigeria , you will succeed abroad. <br/><br/>I know what I&#39;m saying!</div></div>

That is quite accurate Node can&#39;t handle CPU Request, it&#39;s best for Real Time and Async, in that regard I will move to Spring or Go for speed, Node exceeds for most I/O operations. Enceladus is right , React not being opinionated is a pain point, at Interswitch 7 React Developers all write differently, one uses Saga thunk, the other uses another store management, then some Functional and some Class Approach, Vue and Svelte are one of those frameworks where you focus on the work than the engineering. Working on complex projects will expose all the pain points. <br/><br/>The Frontend is a mess, I will find my way soon to Flutter and Java World, even npm ecosystem is a fiasco, all it takes is to pull a bad package and you can spend the whole day finding out what the hell is going on.</div></div>

The opportunities are numerous. Almost every job vacancy out there is tech this tech that, developer this and developer that. I stayed in school for 4 years studying for a useless engineering degree and I have never in my life seen a vacancy for the rubbish I studied but there are tech roles every day. But in spite of so many jobs in tech, a lot of new developers struggle to get opportunities. I started being active in the tech community recently and I am meeting developers who have been coding for 5 to 7 years but have never had an opportunity. <br/><br/>Tech pays provided you do it right men. </blockquote><br/>You write well but what I appreciate about you is you are willing to share your knowledge with others. That is highly commendable.<br/>Good to know you&#39;re making progress in your journey as a developer. You may think your degree is useless but it&#39;s definitely is helping you in ways you don&#39;t realize.<br/><br/>For most Nigerians they only care about what brings food to the table and any IT skill that does that is cool. A guy in Abj rakes in 2k monthly on graphics design without knowing a single line of code. So I also advise everyone to just niche down and follow what works best for you.<br/><br/>One piece of advise is for you to know that public articles are subject to criticisms. Some will benefit from what you wrote while others will disagree and even abuse you. <br/><br/>How you respond to these demonstrate your soft skills. Pls note that developing soft skill is also very important, I&#39;ve been in few interview sessions and sometimes not the best person technically is employed. <br/>In my previous job our best Engineer got fired because of a slight brawl in the office. <br/><br/>Pls learn to be calm under provocation, that itself is a life skill.<br/>Rgds</div></div>

I recommend PHP and java to people. PHP for startups and medium sized companies and java for enterprise level companies. The same thing you say about Nodejs is what I got told about but there&#39;s so few node jobs out there. It&#39;s just hyped up. And PHP isn&#39;t relevant because of wordpress. There&#39;s other platforms built with PHP which are very complicated and aren&#39;t known by a lot of Devs but they are widely used. Theres Moodle, there&#39;s Magento. The list is endless. Those platforms are why PHP is the major backend for the web. Most of the top universities in the world have their websites powered up by Moodle. I haven&#39;t started learning PHP and working with wordpress and jamstack sites for up to three months and the difference in my life is clear. I am still a junior developer with less than one year experience but I am on my third remote job and recently just got another offer. So I work for two companies presently with less than one year experience. One of them is even a well funded startup in California. I am building out the whole website in wordpress and React. Their major product is not on their website so the backend is powered by WordPress. </blockquote>I am a web designer with years of experience building websites with WordPress. I have created e-commerce, corporate, educational and many other types of website with WordPress. I work with a company in Lagos as their in-house web designer, and we use WordPress majorly for creating beautiful websites for our numerous clients. I&#39;m looking for remote job to augment my daytime job, do you think there are foreign companies that offer remote jobs for skilled WordPress experts like me? I&#39;m also planning to learn PHP because WordPress is built with PHP, what&#39;s your advice on that? Thanks.</div></div>

    <div style="line-height:20px;white-space: pre-wrap;" class="comment-text"><div class="narrow"><blockquote><a href="/post/99249885"><b>tensazangetsu20</b></a>:<br/>Tech is honestly the best industry to get into right now. The opportunities are numerous. Almost every job vacancy out there is tech this tech that, developer this and developer that. I stayed in school for 4 years studying for a useless engineering degree and I have never in my life seen a vacancy for the rubbish I studied but there are tech roles every day. But in spite of so many jobs in tech, a lot of new developers struggle to get opportunities. I started being active in the tech community recently and I am meeting developers who have been coding for 5 to 7 years but have never had an opportunity. Talking with them has led me to discover that it&#39;s actually not the tech industry but a few of the reasons I am listing below.<br/><br/>1. You follow the trends: A lot of us developers love to focus on the sexy trendy stuff. Newsflash, what is sexy and trendy isn&#39;t used and even when used is used by very few companies. So millions of people who have struggled to learn the sexy stuff are all going to fight for those few roles out there. Take for example the latest coolest CSS framework tailwind. It&#39;s really cool and hyped up and it&#39;s like the go-to framework right now but the thing is in the industry people are still using bootstrap. People are learning tailwind but they don&#39;t know the number one CSS framework out there. Just because something is cool and sexy doesn&#39;t mean that everyone is going to switch to it overnight. <br/><br/>If you give junior developers a chance between Angular, React, and Vue. A lot of people are going to pick Vue. They will say it&#39;s sexy and cool and has a ton of GitHub stars. There are jobs using Vue but they are so few compared to React and Angular that you would be pigeonholing yourself by learning that. Theres a whole of difference between coding for fun and coding to get a job.<br/><br/>2. You have unrealistic expectations: This is something I usually see on Reddit cscareerquestions but it seems to becoming a norm amongst everybody. People believe that if your salary isnt starting at 100k USD a year or you dont work for a tech company, you arent a developer. Its so elitist and unfortunately a lot of developers in Nigeria are beginning to have this mindset. They learn HTML, CSS, JS. They have built absolutely no projects but because someone said you need the knowledge of DSA to get a job they immediately start grinding leetcode day and night with the hope of getting into Google. You learnt to code from a Udemy course and you really want to compete at DSAs with people who went to MIT. People who have been doing competitive programming since 5 years old. People who get gold medals at the international olympaids of informatics like its nothing.  <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"/> <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"/> <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"/>. Funny enough, I also had this mindset when I was learning to code but corrected myself later on. The truth is that not every tech job out there tests with DSA or needs knowledge of DSA and not everybody must work for a big tech company. This reasoning is so flawed. It is like saying every lawyer must work for law firms like wale olanipekun and co or every engineer must work for exxonmobil. There are a ton of jobs that will pay you well as a junior developer like really well and you need not struggle to get them. They wont test you with DSA. They would only look at the complexities of your projects and go through them with you. By well paid I am talking of 500k and above. Ask yourself how many people asking you to do DSA in Nigeria have not yet worked at Google. There are even whatsapp groups dedicated to DSA and if you cant solve one you are kicked out. The person giving you DSA is not working at Google or Facebook hmm give yourself a brain o.<br/><br/><br/>3. You do not know how to cut off the bullshit from social media: There&#39;s so much information out there today but if you don&#39;t know how to cut off the bullshit from what you need, you would waste your time. A lot of influencers and creators are putting information out there for themselves. They follow the algorithms and put out what is going to give them the most value in terms of money for their time. If I put out WordPress content, nobody will watch it but if I go out there and make MERN stack tutorials I would be getting millions of views but to be truthful you do not need the MERN stack as a junior. No one is using MongoDB in prod. Very few websites use Nodejs. You are just limiting yourself with that. If you want to be a full stack developer look at things like C# and Java springboot. Those pay really really well and there are even certifications you can acquire in those frameworks that can help get you opportunities at enterprise companies that use them especially if you don&#39;t have a computer science degree.<br/><br/>4 Your projects are not worth paying for:  People put out calculators, todo lists, tictactoe games and a lot of bullshit on their portfolio and wonder why they aren&#39;t getting interviews. You have applied for 100 jobs and haven&#39;t been called back and you absolutely do not know the reason why. Nobody is going to hire you with a to-do list and a calculator on your portfolio. Even if you get an interview, is a calculator something you are going to show your interviewer. What happened to making a social media application, a chat application, a blog, an analytic tool, a dashboard. Something that people actually use in the real world every day. I remember one of the first interviews I have, one of my projects was a payment application I used paystacks API for. Everything was done with HTML, CSS and Javascript and once my interviewer saw the project and the button I used to connect the API, he made an offer to me immediately. Your projects matter especially as a beginner. One solid project is better than 100 garbage projects.<br/><br/>5 You don&#39;t research: Honestly, in this tech thing, I take what everyone is saying as bullshit. The senior developer I work with an Australian guy was telling me to learn web assembly if I really want to get a job with visa sponsorship which I so desperately need. I am tired of remote especially doing it from this shithole zoo of a country. I went to Linkedin Jobs and various countries indeed websites and I couldn&#39;t even see up to 500 jobs total in web assembly. Why would I waste time learning something that has no jobs because it might be relevant in ten years. Nodejs came out in 2009 and it is still not relevant in 2021. What is the probability that web assembly will be relevant in 2031. Research. When people tell you to learn a technology. Go to linkedinjobs and indeed and check how many jobs exist for that technology worldwide. People always advise you from their own point of view but the point of view of a senior developer in America, Europe or Australia is not the same for you a junior developer in the world&#39;s poverty capital.<br/><br/>Tech pays provided you do it right men. </blockquote><br/><b>Go fck yourself.<br/><br/>If you gonna  denigrate Nigeria to make your point, go and eat shiiit. <br/><br/>Asswipe.</b></div></div>

    <div style="line-height:20px;white-space: pre-wrap;" class="comment-text"><div class="narrow">Noted:<br/><br/>Let&#39;s cease all these personal attacks, this is a thread to learn. We are getting back to learning mode. Personally I don&#39;t read much in Junior or Senior title, I just read and study on what I need to do, obviously someone with more time and experience on a project will always exhibit competency. <br/><br/>Being a TeamLead is possible in Andela but outside Andela it is hard, Andela sped up people&#39;s title to match customer&#39;s demands, I know because at Interswitch to become a Team Lead takes years and years, but these days all that can be avoided if you take on bigger roles and display competency, everybody has the opportunity to be a team lead it just means there is alot for the person to learn. <br/><br/>That has always been my perception, I feel the reason why most of the Junior Engineers got canned at Andela where because they were ushered into learning frameworks rather than the core underlying topics .e.g Algorithm, Data Structure and others. I still feel they are massively important but there are roles that require no DS, if you build products/plugins route and are successful you won&#39;t need the DS as much but later on, when your product hits a massive number, Algo and DS will prove important because you will need a smarter and more efficient way to deal with large input. So I recommend Algo and DS, it also helps break down a problem easily.</div></div>

    <div style="line-height:20px;white-space: pre-wrap;" class="comment-text"><div class="narrow"><blockquote><a href="/post/99249885"><b>tensazangetsu20</b></a>:<br/>Tech is honestly the best industry to get into right now. The opportunities are numerous. Almost every job vacancy out there is tech this tech that, developer this and developer that. I stayed in school for 4 years studying for a useless engineering degree and I have never in my life seen a vacancy for the rubbish I studied but there are tech roles every day. But in spite of so many jobs in tech, a lot of new developers struggle to get opportunities. I started being active in the tech community recently and I am meeting developers who have been coding for 5 to 7 years but have never had an opportunity. Talking with them has led me to discover that it&#39;s actually not the tech industry but a few of the reasons I am listing below.<br/><br/>1. You follow the trends: A lot of us developers love to focus on the sexy trendy stuff. Newsflash, what is sexy and trendy isn&#39;t used and even when used is used by very few companies. So millions of people who have struggled to learn the sexy stuff are all going to fight for those few roles out there. Take for example the latest coolest CSS framework tailwind. It&#39;s really cool and hyped up and it&#39;s like the go-to framework right now but the thing is in the industry people are still using bootstrap. People are learning tailwind but they don&#39;t know the number one CSS framework out there. Just because something is cool and sexy doesn&#39;t mean that everyone is going to switch to it overnight. <br/><br/>If you give junior developers a chance between Angular, React, and Vue. A lot of people are going to pick Vue. They will say it&#39;s sexy and cool and has a ton of GitHub stars. There are jobs using Vue but they are so few compared to React and Angular that you would be pigeonholing yourself by learning that. Theres a whole of difference between coding for fun and coding to get a job.<br/><br/>2. You have unrealistic expectations: This is something I usually see on Reddit cscareerquestions but it seems to becoming a norm amongst everybody. People believe that if your salary isnt starting at 100k USD a year or you dont work for a tech company, you arent a developer. Its so elitist and unfortunately a lot of developers in Nigeria are beginning to have this mindset. They learn HTML, CSS, JS. They have built absolutely no projects but because someone said you need the knowledge of DSA to get a job they immediately start grinding leetcode day and night with the hope of getting into Google. You learnt to code from a Udemy course and you really want to compete at DSAs with people who went to MIT. People who have been doing competitive programming since 5 years old. People who get gold medals at the international olympaids of informatics like its nothing.  <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"/> <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"/> <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"/>. Funny enough, I also had this mindset when I was learning to code but corrected myself later on. The truth is that not every tech job out there tests with DSA or needs knowledge of DSA and not everybody must work for a big tech company. This reasoning is so flawed. It is like saying every lawyer must work for law firms like wale olanipekun and co or every engineer must work for exxonmobil. There are a ton of jobs that will pay you well as a junior developer like really well and you need not struggle to get them. They wont test you with DSA. They would only look at the complexities of your projects and go through them with you. By well paid I am talking of 500k and above. Ask yourself how many people asking you to do DSA in Nigeria have not yet worked at Google. There are even whatsapp groups dedicated to DSA and if you cant solve one you are kicked out. The person giving you DSA is not working at Google or Facebook hmm give yourself a brain o.<br/><br/><br/>3. You do not know how to cut off the bullshit from social media: There&#39;s so much information out there today but if you don&#39;t know how to cut off the bullshit from what you need, you would waste your time. A lot of influencers and creators are putting information out there for themselves. They follow the algorithms and put out what is going to give them the most value in terms of money for their time. If I put out WordPress content, nobody will watch it but if I go out there and make MERN stack tutorials I would be getting millions of views but to be truthful you do not need the MERN stack as a junior. No one is using MongoDB in prod. Very few websites use Nodejs. You are just limiting yourself with that. If you want to be a full stack developer look at things like C# and Java springboot. Those pay really really well and there are even certifications you can acquire in those frameworks that can help get you opportunities at enterprise companies that use them especially if you don&#39;t have a computer science degree.<br/><br/>4 Your projects are not worth paying for:  People put out calculators, todo lists, tictactoe games and a lot of bullshit on their portfolio and wonder why they aren&#39;t getting interviews. You have applied for 100 jobs and haven&#39;t been called back and you absolutely do not know the reason why. Nobody is going to hire you with a to-do list and a calculator on your portfolio. Even if you get an interview, is a calculator something you are going to show your interviewer. What happened to making a social media application, a chat application, a blog, an analytic tool, a dashboard. Something that people actually use in the real world every day. I remember one of the first interviews I have, one of my projects was a payment application I used paystacks API for. Everything was done with HTML, CSS and Javascript and once my interviewer saw the project and the button I used to connect the API, he made an offer to me immediately. Your projects matter especially as a beginner. One solid project is better than 100 garbage projects.<br/><br/>5 You don&#39;t research: Honestly, in this tech thing, I take what everyone is saying as bullshit. The senior developer I work with an Australian guy was telling me to learn web assembly if I really want to get a job with visa sponsorship which I so desperately need. I am tired of remote especially doing it from this shithole zoo of a country. I went to Linkedin Jobs and various countries indeed websites and I couldn&#39;t even see up to 500 jobs total in web assembly. Why would I waste time learning something that has no jobs because it might be relevant in ten years. Nodejs came out in 2009 and it is still not relevant in 2021. What is the probability that web assembly will be relevant in 2031. Research. When people tell you to learn a technology. Go to linkedinjobs and indeed and check how many jobs exist for that technology worldwide. People always advise you from their own point of view but the point of view of a senior developer in America, Europe or Australia is not the same for you a junior developer in the world&#39;s poverty capital.<br/><br/>Tech pays provided you do it right men. </blockquote>Chai me that want to go back to the University and study information technology again!!  What do you advice me?</div></div>

The opportunities are numerous. Almost every job vacancy out there is tech this tech that, developer this and developer that. I stayed in school for 4 years studying for a useless engineering degree and I have never in my life seen a vacancy for the rubbish I studied but there are tech roles every day. But in spite of so many jobs in tech, a lot of new developers struggle to get opportunities. I started being active in the tech community recently and I am meeting developers who have been coding for 5 to 7 years but have never had an opportunity. Talking with them has led me to discover that it&#39;s actually not the tech industry but a few of the reasons I am listing below.<br/><br/>1. You follow the trends: A lot of us developers love to focus on the sexy trendy stuff. Newsflash, what is sexy and trendy isn&#39;t used and even when used is used by very few companies. So millions of people who have struggled to learn the sexy stuff are all going to fight for those few roles out there. Take for example the latest coolest CSS framework tailwind. It&#39;s really cool and hyped up and it&#39;s like the go-to framework right now but the thing is in the industry people are still using bootstrap. People are learning tailwind but they don&#39;t know the number one CSS framework out there. Just because something is cool and sexy doesn&#39;t mean that everyone is going to switch to it overnight. <br/><br/>If you give junior developers a chance between Angular, React, and Vue. A lot of people are going to pick Vue. They will say it&#39;s sexy and cool and has a ton of GitHub stars. There are jobs using Vue but they are so few compared to React and Angular that you would be pigeonholing yourself by learning that. Theres a whole of difference between coding for fun and coding to get a job.<br/><br/>2. You have unrealistic expectations: This is something I usually see on Reddit cscareerquestions but it seems to becoming a norm amongst everybody. People believe that if your salary isnt starting at 100k USD a year or you dont work for a tech company, you arent a developer. Its so elitist and unfortunately a lot of developers in Nigeria are beginning to have this mindset. They learn HTML, CSS, JS. They have built absolutely no projects but because someone said you need the knowledge of DSA to get a job they immediately start grinding leetcode day and night with the hope of getting into Google. You learnt to code from a Udemy course and you really want to compete at DSAs with people who went to MIT. People who have been doing competitive programming since 5 years old. People who get gold medals at the international olympaids of informatics like its nothing.  <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"/> <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"/> <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"/>. Funny enough, I also had this mindset when I was learning to code but corrected myself later on. The truth is that not every tech job out there tests with DSA or needs knowledge of DSA and not everybody must work for a big tech company. This reasoning is so flawed. It is like saying every lawyer must work for law firms like wale olanipekun and co or every engineer must work for exxonmobil. There are a ton of jobs that will pay you well as a junior developer like really well and you need not struggle to get them. They wont test you with DSA. They would only look at the complexities of your projects and go through them with you. By well paid I am talking of 500k and above. Ask yourself how many people asking you to do DSA in Nigeria have not yet worked at Google. There are even whatsapp groups dedicated to DSA and if you cant solve one you are kicked out. The person giving you DSA is not working at Google or Facebook hmm give yourself a brain o.<br/><br/><br/>3. You do not know how to cut off the bullshit from social media: There&#39;s so much information out there today but if you don&#39;t know how to cut off the bullshit from what you need, you would waste your time. A lot of influencers and creators are putting information out there for themselves. They follow the algorithms and put out what is going to give them the most value in terms of money for their time. If I put out WordPress content, nobody will watch it but if I go out there and make MERN stack tutorials I would be getting millions of views but to be truthful you do not need the MERN stack as a junior. No one is using MongoDB in prod. Very few websites use Nodejs. You are just limiting yourself with that. If you want to be a full stack developer look at things like C# and Java springboot. Those pay really really well and there are even certifications you can acquire in those frameworks that can help get you opportunities at enterprise companies that use them especially if you don&#39;t have a computer science degree.<br/><br/>4 Your projects are not worth paying for:  People put out calculators, todo lists, tictactoe games and a lot of bullshit on their portfolio and wonder why they aren&#39;t getting interviews. You have applied for 100 jobs and haven&#39;t been called back and you absolutely do not know the reason why. Nobody is going to hire you with a to-do list and a calculator on your portfolio. Even if you get an interview, is a calculator something you are going to show your interviewer. What happened to making a social media application, a chat application, a blog, an analytic tool, a dashboard. Something that people actually use in the real world every day. I remember one of the first interviews I have, one of my projects was a payment application I used paystacks API for. Everything was done with HTML, CSS and Javascript and once my interviewer saw the project and the button I used to connect the API, he made an offer to me immediately. Your projects matter especially as a beginner. One solid project is better than 100 garbage projects.<br/><br/>5 You don&#39;t research: Honestly, in this tech thing, I take what everyone is saying as bullshit. The senior developer I work with an Australian guy was telling me to learn web assembly if I really want to get a job with visa sponsorship which I so desperately need. I am tired of remote especially doing it from this shithole zoo of a country. I went to Linkedin Jobs and various countries indeed websites and I couldn&#39;t even see up to 500 jobs total in web assembly. Why would I waste time learning something that has no jobs because it might be relevant in ten years. Nodejs came out in 2009 and it is still not relevant in 2021. What is the probability that web assembly will be relevant in 2031. Research. When people tell you to learn a technology. Go to linkedinjobs and indeed and check how many jobs exist for that technology worldwide. People always advise you from their own point of view but the point of view of a senior developer in America, Europe or Australia is not the same for you a junior developer in the world&#39;s poverty capital.<br/><br/>Tech pays provided you do it right men. </blockquote><br/>Teach people to learn how to learn that is what software engineering is all about. You have to keep learning things .<br/><br/>Saying NodeJs or MongoDb is irrelevant is myopic,  however I do agree that the job market should help junior developers optimize their learning.</div></div>

Those pay really really well and there are even certifications you can acquire in those frameworks that can help get you opportunities at enterprise companies that use them especially if you don&#39;t have a computer science degree.<br/><br/>4 Your projects are not worth paying for:  People put out calculators, todo lists, tictactoe games and a lot of bullshit on their portfolio and wonder why they aren&#39;t getting interviews. You have applied for 100 jobs and haven&#39;t been called back and you absolutely do not know the reason why. Nobody is going to hire you with a to-do list and a calculator on your portfolio. Even if you get an interview, is a calculator something you are going to show your interviewer. What happened to making a social media application, a chat application, a blog, an analytic tool, a dashboard. Something that people actually use in the real world every day. I remember one of the first interviews I have, one of my projects was a payment application I used paystacks API for. Everything was done with HTML, CSS and Javascript and once my interviewer saw the project and the button I used to connect the API, he made an offer to me immediately. Your projects matter especially as a beginner. One solid project is better than 100 garbage projects.<br/><br/>5 You don&#39;t research: Honestly, in this tech thing, I take what everyone is saying as bullshit. The senior developer I work with an Australian guy was telling me to learn web assembly if I really want to get a job with visa sponsorship which I so desperately need. I am tired of remote especially doing it from this shithole zoo of a country. I went to Linkedin Jobs and various countries indeed websites and I couldn&#39;t even see up to 500 jobs total in web assembly. Why would I waste time learning something that has no jobs because it might be relevant in ten years. Nodejs came out in 2009 and it is still not relevant in 2021. What is the probability that web assembly will be relevant in 2031. Research. When people tell you to learn a technology. Go to linkedinjobs and indeed and check how many jobs exist for that technology worldwide. People always advise you from their own point of view but the point of view of a senior developer in America, Europe or Australia is not the same for you a junior developer in the world&#39;s poverty capital.<br/><br/>Tech pays provided you do it right men. </blockquote><br/>Well!! Angular is a modern type of framework that allows organizing an integrated custom approach to solve tasks in a large and complex project. When it comes to angular development you need to <a rel="ugc" href="https://www.aalpha.net/articles/how-to-hire-angular-developers/">hire angular developers</a> from India as they more skilled to develop large projects</div></div>

    <div style="line-height:20px;white-space: pre-wrap;" class="comment-text"><div class="narrow"><blockquote><a href="/post/99249885"><b>tensazangetsu20</b></a>:<br/>Tech is honestly the best industry to get into right now. The opportunities are numerous. Almost every job vacancy out there is tech this tech that, developer this and developer that. I stayed in school for 4 years studying for a useless engineering degree and I have never in my life seen a vacancy for the rubbish I studied but there are tech roles every day. But in spite of so many jobs in tech, a lot of new developers struggle to get opportunities. I started being active in the tech community recently and I am meeting developers who have been coding for 5 to 7 years but have never had an opportunity. Talking with them has led me to discover that it&#39;s actually not the tech industry but a few of the reasons I am listing below.<br/><br/>1. You follow the trends: A lot of us developers love to focus on the sexy trendy stuff. Newsflash, what is sexy and trendy isn&#39;t used and even when used is used by very few companies. So millions of people who have struggled to learn the sexy stuff are all going to fight for those few roles out there. Take for example the latest coolest CSS framework tailwind. It&#39;s really cool and hyped up and it&#39;s like the go-to framework right now but the thing is in the industry people are still using bootstrap. People are learning tailwind but they don&#39;t know the number one CSS framework out there. Just because something is cool and sexy doesn&#39;t mean that everyone is going to switch to it overnight. <br/><br/>If you give junior developers a chance between Angular, React, and Vue. A lot of people are going to pick Vue. They will say it&#39;s sexy and cool and has a ton of GitHub stars. There are jobs using Vue but they are so few compared to React and Angular that you would be pigeonholing yourself by learning that. Theres a whole of difference between coding for fun and coding to get a job.<br/><br/>2. You have unrealistic expectations: This is something I usually see on Reddit cscareerquestions but it seems to becoming a norm amongst everybody. People believe that if your salary isnt starting at 100k USD a year or you dont work for a tech company, you arent a developer. Its so elitist and unfortunately a lot of developers in Nigeria are beginning to have this mindset. They learn HTML, CSS, JS. They have built absolutely no projects but because someone said you need the knowledge of DSA to get a job they immediately start grinding leetcode day and night with the hope of getting into Google. You learnt to code from a Udemy course and you really want to compete at DSAs with people who went to MIT. People who have been doing competitive programming since 5 years old. People who get gold medals at the international olympaids of informatics like its nothing.  <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"/> <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"/> <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"/>. Funny enough, I also had this mindset when I was learning to code but corrected myself later on. The truth is that not every tech job out there tests with DSA or needs knowledge of DSA and not everybody must work for a big tech company. This reasoning is so flawed. It is like saying every lawyer must work for law firms like wale olanipekun and co or every engineer must work for exxonmobil. There are a ton of jobs that will pay you well as a junior developer like really well and you need not struggle to get them. They wont test you with DSA. They would only look at the complexities of your projects and go through them with you. By well paid I am talking of 500k and above. Ask yourself how many people asking you to do DSA in Nigeria have not yet worked at Google. There are even whatsapp groups dedicated to DSA and if you cant solve one you are kicked out. The person giving you DSA is not working at Google or Facebook hmm give yourself a brain o.<br/><br/><br/>3. You do not know how to cut off the bullshit from social media: There&#39;s so much information out there today but if you don&#39;t know how to cut off the bullshit from what you need, you would waste your time. A lot of influencers and creators are putting information out there for themselves. They follow the algorithms and put out what is going to give them the most value in terms of money for their time. If I put out WordPress content, nobody will watch it but if I go out there and make MERN stack tutorials I would be getting millions of views but to be truthful you do not need the MERN stack as a junior. No one is using MongoDB in prod. Very few websites use Nodejs. You are just limiting yourself with that. If you want to be a full stack developer look at things like C# and Java springboot. Those pay really really well and there are even certifications you can acquire in those frameworks that can help get you opportunities at enterprise companies that use them especially if you don&#39;t have a computer science degree.<br/><br/>4 Your projects are not worth paying for:  People put out calculators, todo lists, tictactoe games and a lot of bullshit on their portfolio and wonder why they aren&#39;t getting interviews. You have applied for 100 jobs and haven&#39;t been called back and you absolutely do not know the reason why. Nobody is going to hire you with a to-do list and a calculator on your portfolio. Even if you get an interview, is a calculator something you are going to show your interviewer. What happened to making a social media application, a chat application, a blog, an analytic tool, a dashboard. Something that people actually use in the real world every day. I remember one of the first interviews I have, one of my projects was a payment application I used paystacks API for. Everything was done with HTML, CSS and Javascript and once my interviewer saw the project and the button I used to connect the API, he made an offer to me immediately. Your projects matter especially as a beginner. One solid project is better than 100 garbage projects.<br/><br/>5 You don&#39;t research: Honestly, in this tech thing, I take what everyone is saying as bullshit. The senior developer I work with an Australian guy was telling me to learn web assembly if I really want to get a job with visa sponsorship which I so desperately need. I am tired of remote especially doing it from this shithole zoo of a country. I went to Linkedin Jobs and various countries indeed websites and I couldn&#39;t even see up to 500 jobs total in web assembly. Why would I waste time learning something that has no jobs because it might be relevant in ten years. Nodejs came out in 2009 and it is still not relevant in 2021. What is the probability that web assembly will be relevant in 2031. Research. When people tell you to learn a technology. Go to linkedinjobs and indeed and check how many jobs exist for that technology worldwide. People always advise you from their own point of view but the point of view of a senior developer in America, Europe or Australia is not the same for you a junior developer in the world&#39;s poverty capital.<br/><br/>Tech pays provided you do it right men. </blockquote> <br/>I love this</div></div>

    <div style="line-height:20px;white-space: pre-wrap;" class="comment-text"><div class="narrow"><blockquote><a href="/post/99249885"><b>tensazangetsu20</b></a>:<br/>Tech is honestly the best industry to get into right now. The opportunities are numerous. Almost every job vacancy out there is tech this tech that, developer this and developer that. I stayed in school for 4 years studying for a useless engineering degree and I have never in my life seen a vacancy for the rubbish I studied but there are tech roles every day. But in spite of so many jobs in tech, a lot of new developers struggle to get opportunities. I started being active in the tech community recently and I am meeting developers who have been coding for 5 to 7 years but have never had an opportunity. Talking with them has led me to discover that it&#39;s actually not the tech industry but a few of the reasons I am listing below.<br/><br/>1. You follow the trends: A lot of us developers love to focus on the sexy trendy stuff. Newsflash, what is sexy and trendy isn&#39;t used and even when used is used by very few companies. So millions of people who have struggled to learn the sexy stuff are all going to fight for those few roles out there. Take for example the latest coolest CSS framework tailwind. It&#39;s really cool and hyped up and it&#39;s like the go-to framework right now but the thing is in the industry people are still using bootstrap. People are learning tailwind but they don&#39;t know the number one CSS framework out there. Just because something is cool and sexy doesn&#39;t mean that everyone is going to switch to it overnight. <br/><br/>If you give junior developers a chance between Angular, React, and Vue. A lot of people are going to pick Vue. They will say it&#39;s sexy and cool and has a ton of GitHub stars. There are jobs using Vue but they are so few compared to React and Angular that you would be pigeonholing yourself by learning that. Theres a whole of difference between coding for fun and coding to get a job.<br/><br/>2. You have unrealistic expectations: This is something I usually see on Reddit cscareerquestions but it seems to becoming a norm amongst everybody. People believe that if your salary isnt starting at 100k USD a year or you dont work for a tech company, you arent a developer. Its so elitist and unfortunately a lot of developers in Nigeria are beginning to have this mindset. They learn HTML, CSS, JS. They have built absolutely no projects but because someone said you need the knowledge of DSA to get a job they immediately start grinding leetcode day and night with the hope of getting into Google. You learnt to code from a Udemy course and you really want to compete at DSAs with people who went to MIT. People who have been doing competitive programming since 5 years old. People who get gold medals at the international olympaids of informatics like its nothing.  <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"/> <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"/> <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"/>. Funny enough, I also had this mindset when I was learning to code but corrected myself later on. The truth is that not every tech job out there tests with DSA or needs knowledge of DSA and not everybody must work for a big tech company. This reasoning is so flawed. It is like saying every lawyer must work for law firms like wale olanipekun and co or every engineer must work for exxonmobil. There are a ton of jobs that will pay you well as a junior developer like really well and you need not struggle to get them. They wont test you with DSA. They would only look at the complexities of your projects and go through them with you. By well paid I am talking of 500k and above. Ask yourself how many people asking you to do DSA in Nigeria have not yet worked at Google. There are even whatsapp groups dedicated to DSA and if you cant solve one you are kicked out. The person giving you DSA is not working at Google or Facebook hmm give yourself a brain o.<br/><br/><br/>3. You do not know how to cut off the bullshit from social media: There&#39;s so much information out there today but if you don&#39;t know how to cut off the bullshit from what you need, you would waste your time. A lot of influencers and creators are putting information out there for themselves. They follow the algorithms and put out what is going to give them the most value in terms of money for their time. If I put out WordPress content, nobody will watch it but if I go out there and make MERN stack tutorials I would be getting millions of views but to be truthful you do not need the MERN stack as a junior. No one is using MongoDB in prod. Very few websites use Nodejs. You are just limiting yourself with that. If you want to be a full stack developer look at things like C# and Java springboot. Those pay really really well and there are even certifications you can acquire in those frameworks that can help get you opportunities at enterprise companies that use them especially if you don&#39;t have a computer science degree.<br/><br/>4 Your projects are not worth paying for:  People put out calculators, todo lists, tictactoe games and a lot of bullshit on their portfolio and wonder why they aren&#39;t getting interviews. You have applied for 100 jobs and haven&#39;t been called back and you absolutely do not know the reason why. Nobody is going to hire you with a to-do list and a calculator on your portfolio. Even if you get an interview, is a calculator something you are going to show your interviewer. What happened to making a social media application, a chat application, a blog, an analytic tool, a dashboard. Something that people actually use in the real world every day. I remember one of the first interviews I have, one of my projects was a payment application I used paystacks API for. Everything was done with HTML, CSS and Javascript and once my interviewer saw the project and the button I used to connect the API, he made an offer to me immediately. Your projects matter especially as a beginner. One solid project is better than 100 garbage projects.<br/><br/>5 You don&#39;t research: Honestly, in this tech thing, I take what everyone is saying as bullshit. The senior developer I work with an Australian guy was telling me to learn web assembly if I really want to get a job with visa sponsorship which I so desperately need. I am tired of remote especially doing it from this shithole zoo of a country. I went to Linkedin Jobs and various countries indeed websites and I couldn&#39;t even see up to 500 jobs total in web assembly. Why would I waste time learning something that has no jobs because it might be relevant in ten years. Nodejs came out in 2009 and it is still not relevant in 2021. What is the probability that web assembly will be relevant in 2031. Research. When people tell you to learn a technology. Go to linkedinjobs and indeed and check how many jobs exist for that technology worldwide. People always advise you from their own point of view but the point of view of a senior developer in America, Europe or Australia is not the same for you a junior developer in the world&#39;s poverty capital.<br/><br/>Tech pays provided you do it right men. </blockquote><br/>Pls I sent you DM, kindly check. I would like to reach you</div></div>

I recommend PHP and java to people. PHP for startups and medium sized companies and java for enterprise level companies. The same thing you say about Nodejs is what I got told about but there&#39;s so few node jobs out there. It&#39;s just hyped up. And PHP isn&#39;t relevant because of wordpress. There&#39;s other platforms built with PHP which are very complicated and aren&#39;t known by a lot of Devs but they are widely used. Theres Moodle, there&#39;s Magento. The list is endless. Those platforms are why PHP is the major backend for the web. Most of the top universities in the world have their websites powered up by Moodle. I haven&#39;t started learning PHP and working with wordpress and jamstack sites for up to three months and the difference in my life is clear. I am still a junior developer with less than one year experience but I am on my third remote job and recently just got another offer. So I work for two companies presently with less than one year experience. One of them is even a well funded startup in California. I am building out the whole website in wordpress and React. Their major product is not on their website so the backend is powered by WordPress. </blockquote>So learning WordPress is still lucrative and advisable?</div></div>

NPM being the largest code repo proofs being a junior in such environments with so many devs is a waste of time if you are in Africa and trying to make a living. I hate been compared to some in UK or USA, of course life is easier there but here u got to use your head. How do you even becomes a mid level dev when u have never gotten a job in your stack.<br/><br/>You guys have probably been in the game for a while and have built connections, gotten jobs, gigs in the past. it is easy to say learn Node.js. But remember that the lockdown produced millions of junior self taught devs, Youtube tech channels is the proof for this.<br/><br/>Summary:<br/>If : you want to over train yourself before you get your first gig jumping from one projects, open source stuffs, tools etc. - choose Node.js or what not<br/>else : Choose a small niche with plenty opportunities and lesser competitions not necessary wordpress, odoo et al<br/><br/></blockquote>Small niche like what?</div></div>

    <div style="line-height:20px;white-space: pre-wrap;" class="comment-text"><div class="narrow"><blockquote><a href="/post/99249885"><b>tensazangetsu20</b></a>:<br/>Tech is honestly the best industry to get into right now. The opportunities are numerous. Almost every job vacancy out there is tech this tech that, developer this and developer that. I stayed in school for 4 years studying for a useless engineering degree and I have never in my life seen a vacancy for the rubbish I studied but there are tech roles every day. But in spite of so many jobs in tech, a lot of new developers struggle to get opportunities. I started being active in the tech community recently and I am meeting developers who have been coding for 5 to 7 years but have never had an opportunity. Talking with them has led me to discover that it&#39;s actually not the tech industry but a few of the reasons I am listing below.<br/><br/>1. You follow the trends: A lot of us developers love to focus on the sexy trendy stuff. Newsflash, what is sexy and trendy isn&#39;t used and even when used is used by very few companies. So millions of people who have struggled to learn the sexy stuff are all going to fight for those few roles out there. Take for example the latest coolest CSS framework tailwind. It&#39;s really cool and hyped up and it&#39;s like the go-to framework right now but the thing is in the industry people are still using bootstrap. People are learning tailwind but they don&#39;t know the number one CSS framework out there. Just because something is cool and sexy doesn&#39;t mean that everyone is going to switch to it overnight. <br/><br/>If you give junior developers a chance between Angular, React, and Vue. A lot of people are going to pick Vue. They will say it&#39;s sexy and cool and has a ton of GitHub stars. There are jobs using Vue but they are so few compared to React and Angular that you would be pigeonholing yourself by learning that. Theres a whole of difference between coding for fun and coding to get a job.<br/><br/>2. You have unrealistic expectations: This is something I usually see on Reddit cscareerquestions but it seems to becoming a norm amongst everybody. People believe that if your salary isnt starting at 100k USD a year or you dont work for a tech company, you arent a developer. Its so elitist and unfortunately a lot of developers in Nigeria are beginning to have this mindset. They learn HTML, CSS, JS. They have built absolutely no projects but because someone said you need the knowledge of DSA to get a job they immediately start grinding leetcode day and night with the hope of getting into Google. You learnt to code from a Udemy course and you really want to compete at DSAs with people who went to MIT. People who have been doing competitive programming since 5 years old. People who get gold medals at the international olympaids of informatics like its nothing.  <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"/> <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"/> <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"/>. Funny enough, I also had this mindset when I was learning to code but corrected myself later on. The truth is that not every tech job out there tests with DSA or needs knowledge of DSA and not everybody must work for a big tech company. This reasoning is so flawed. It is like saying every lawyer must work for law firms like wale olanipekun and co or every engineer must work for exxonmobil. There are a ton of jobs that will pay you well as a junior developer like really well and you need not struggle to get them. They wont test you with DSA. They would only look at the complexities of your projects and go through them with you. By well paid I am talking of 500k and above. Ask yourself how many people asking you to do DSA in Nigeria have not yet worked at Google. There are even whatsapp groups dedicated to DSA and if you cant solve one you are kicked out. The person giving you DSA is not working at Google or Facebook hmm give yourself a brain o.<br/><br/><br/>3. You do not know how to cut off the bullshit from social media: There&#39;s so much information out there today but if you don&#39;t know how to cut off the bullshit from what you need, you would waste your time. A lot of influencers and creators are putting information out there for themselves. They follow the algorithms and put out what is going to give them the most value in terms of money for their time. If I put out WordPress content, nobody will watch it but if I go out there and make MERN stack tutorials I would be getting millions of views but to be truthful you do not need the MERN stack as a junior. No one is using MongoDB in prod. Very few websites use Nodejs. You are just limiting yourself with that. If you want to be a full stack developer look at things like C# and Java springboot. Those pay really really well and there are even certifications you can acquire in those frameworks that can help get you opportunities at enterprise companies that use them especially if you don&#39;t have a computer science degree.<br/><br/>4 Your projects are not worth paying for:  People put out calculators, todo lists, tictactoe games and a lot of bullshit on their portfolio and wonder why they aren&#39;t getting interviews. You have applied for 100 jobs and haven&#39;t been called back and you absolutely do not know the reason why. Nobody is going to hire you with a to-do list and a calculator on your portfolio. Even if you get an interview, is a calculator something you are going to show your interviewer. What happened to making a social media application, a chat application, a blog, an analytic tool, a dashboard. Something that people actually use in the real world every day. I remember one of the first interviews I have, one of my projects was a payment application I used paystacks API for. Everything was done with HTML, CSS and Javascript and once my interviewer saw the project and the button I used to connect the API, he made an offer to me immediately. Your projects matter especially as a beginner. One solid project is better than 100 garbage projects.<br/><br/>5 You don&#39;t research: Honestly, in this tech thing, I take what everyone is saying as bullshit. The senior developer I work with an Australian guy was telling me to learn web assembly if I really want to get a job with visa sponsorship which I so desperately need. I am tired of remote especially doing it from this shithole zoo of a country. I went to Linkedin Jobs and various countries indeed websites and I couldn&#39;t even see up to 500 jobs total in web assembly. Why would I waste time learning something that has no jobs because it might be relevant in ten years. Nodejs came out in 2009 and it is still not relevant in 2021. What is the probability that web assembly will be relevant in 2031. Research. When people tell you to learn a technology. Go to linkedinjobs and indeed and check how many jobs exist for that technology worldwide. People always advise you from their own point of view but the point of view of a senior developer in America, Europe or Australia is not the same for you a junior developer in the world&#39;s poverty capital.<br/><br/>Tech pays provided you do it right men. </blockquote><br/>How can you say mongodb is not used in production? This is a very ignorant and misleading statement. Java /c# is not even in the top 5 most used languages as at current. Javascript/nodejs still tops the list.. Alongsides python, php, golang, rust and ruby on rails..  The only companies that still use java/c# are older enterprise companies with legacy codebases. Even at that some are alr3sdy moving to kotlin or exploring other newer and better technologies. There&#39;s nothing java/c# can do now that golang doesn&#39;t do better.

Every company I&#39;ve interviewed for (both home and abroad) required me to take coding tests on Codility/hackerrank in their early  stages.<br/><br/>You really need to do a lot of research yourself..

    <div style="line-height:20px;white-space: pre-wrap;" class="comment-text"><div class="narrow">Thank you for this beautiful thread @OP.<br/>I believe many people just got your point wrong. It&#39;s not as if all these other stuffs are not important but we need to earn few bucks as Juniors while learning too. Rome wasn&#39;t built in a day. <br/><br/>As a beginner, it can be very demotivating when I hear people say that you need to keep learning for over two years before you can make some money. Some will say learn DSA for 6 months, learn dis and dat for another 1 year etc. Omo, SAPA dey this country ooh. What will a man use to hold body and soul during those moments? How will you even watch videos talk more of coding when you don&#39;t have the constant money for data?<br/><br/>This is what the OP is simply trying to state here I think.  I also understand that seniors in the house would view his write-up differently Sha. This is very normal based on the fact that you&#39;re no longer in the shoes of junior developers that are just struggling to get something out there while maintaining body and soul. At that level, you will probably care much more about ethics and standard ways I think.</div></div>

    <div style="line-height:20px;white-space: pre-wrap;" class="comment-text"><div class="narrow"><blockquote><a href="/post/99249885"><b>tensazangetsu20</b></a>:<br/>Tech is honestly the best industry to get into right now. The opportunities are numerous. Almost every job vacancy out there is tech this tech that, developer this and developer that. I stayed in school for 4 years studying for a useless engineering degree and I have never in my life seen a vacancy for the rubbish I studied but there are tech roles every day. But in spite of so many jobs in tech, a lot of new developers struggle to get opportunities. I started being active in the tech community recently and I am meeting developers who have been coding for 5 to 7 years but have never had an opportunity. Talking with them has led me to discover that it&#39;s actually not the tech industry but a few of the reasons I am listing below.<br/><br/>1. You follow the trends: A lot of us developers love to focus on the sexy trendy stuff. Newsflash, what is sexy and trendy isn&#39;t used and even when used is used by very few companies. So millions of people who have struggled to learn the sexy stuff are all going to fight for those few roles out there. Take for example the latest coolest CSS framework tailwind. It&#39;s really cool and hyped up and it&#39;s like the go-to framework right now but the thing is in the industry people are still using bootstrap. People are learning tailwind but they don&#39;t know the number one CSS framework out there. Just because something is cool and sexy doesn&#39;t mean that everyone is going to switch to it overnight. <br/><br/>If you give junior developers a chance between Angular, React, and Vue. A lot of people are going to pick Vue. They will say it&#39;s sexy and cool and has a ton of GitHub stars. There are jobs using Vue but they are so few compared to React and Angular that you would be pigeonholing yourself by learning that. Theres a whole of difference between coding for fun and coding to get a job.<br/><br/>2. You have unrealistic expectations: This is something I usually see on Reddit cscareerquestions but it seems to becoming a norm amongst everybody. People believe that if your salary isnt starting at 100k USD a year or you dont work for a tech company, you arent a developer. Its so elitist and unfortunately a lot of developers in Nigeria are beginning to have this mindset. They learn HTML, CSS, JS. They have built absolutely no projects but because someone said you need the knowledge of DSA to get a job they immediately start grinding leetcode day and night with the hope of getting into Google. You learnt to code from a Udemy course and you really want to compete at DSAs with people who went to MIT. People who have been doing competitive programming since 5 years old. People who get gold medals at the international olympaids of informatics like its nothing.  <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"/> <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"/> <img src="https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png" alt="grin" border="0" class="faces"/>. Funny enough, I also had this mindset when I was learning to code but corrected myself later on. The truth is that not every tech job out there tests with DSA or needs knowledge of DSA and not everybody must work for a big tech company. This reasoning is so flawed. It is like saying every lawyer must work for law firms like wale olanipekun and co or every engineer must work for exxonmobil. There are a ton of jobs that will pay you well as a junior developer like really well and you need not struggle to get them. They wont test you with DSA. They would only look at the complexities of your projects and go through them with you. By well paid I am talking of 500k and above. Ask yourself how many people asking you to do DSA in Nigeria have not yet worked at Google. There are even whatsapp groups dedicated to DSA and if you cant solve one you are kicked out. The person giving you DSA is not working at Google or Facebook hmm give yourself a brain o.<br/><br/><br/>3. You do not know how to cut off the bullshit from social media: There&#39;s so much information out there today but if you don&#39;t know how to cut off the bullshit from what you need, you would waste your time. A lot of influencers and creators are putting information out there for themselves. They follow the algorithms and put out what is going to give them the most value in terms of money for their time. If I put out WordPress content, nobody will watch it but if I go out there and make MERN stack tutorials I would be getting millions of views but to be truthful you do not need the MERN stack as a junior. No one is using MongoDB in prod. Very few websites use Nodejs. You are just limiting yourself with that. If you want to be a full stack developer look at things like C# and Java springboot. Those pay really really well and there are even certifications you can acquire in those frameworks that can help get you opportunities at enterprise companies that use them especially if you don&#39;t have a computer science degree.<br/><br/>4 Your projects are not worth paying for:  People put out calculators, todo lists, tictactoe games and a lot of bullshit on their portfolio and wonder why they aren&#39;t getting interviews. You have applied for 100 jobs and haven&#39;t been called back and you absolutely do not know the reason why. Nobody is going to hire you with a to-do list and a calculator on your portfolio. Even if you get an interview, is a calculator something you are going to show your interviewer. What happened to making a social media application, a chat application, a blog, an analytic tool, a dashboard. Something that people actually use in the real world every day. I remember one of the first interviews I have, one of my projects was a payment application I used paystacks API for. Everything was done with HTML, CSS and Javascript and once my interviewer saw the project and the button I used to connect the API, he made an offer to me immediately. Your projects matter especially as a beginner. One solid project is better than 100 garbage projects.<br/><br/>5 You don&#39;t research: Honestly, in this tech thing, I take what everyone is saying as bullshit. The senior developer I work with an Australian guy was telling me to learn web assembly if I really want to get a job with visa sponsorship which I so desperately need. I am tired of remote especially doing it from this shithole zoo of a country. I went to Linkedin Jobs and various countries indeed websites and I couldn&#39;t even see up to 500 jobs total in web assembly. Why would I waste time learning something that has no jobs because it might be relevant in ten years. Nodejs came out in 2009 and it is still not relevant in 2021. What is the probability that web assembly will be relevant in 2031. Research. When people tell you to learn a technology. Go to linkedinjobs and indeed and check how many jobs exist for that technology worldwide. People always advise you from their own point of view but the point of view of a senior developer in America, Europe or Australia is not the same for you a junior developer in the world&#39;s poverty capital.<br/><br/>Tech pays provided you do it right men. </blockquote> Hello Tensa, I am one of your ardent follower sir.<br/>I started learning python early this year, but due to hustle and other distractions I stopped learning, <br/><br/>honestly at first i was learning python for data analytics but then I learnt that Excel and other stuffs related to data analytics are not my thing, what i am really passionate about is Backend web dev, and after following your posts here, I learnt that web dev either backend or frontend with Python is just unnecessary waste of time.<br/><br/> I decided to follow your advice and go for PHP, one of my Oga at work is also a PHP dev so learning PHP wont be an issue for me since I have a mentor who can guide me.<br/>Now the issue is I prefer Backend than frontend, please i need guidance, especially on the right path to take and also the roadmap I should follow.<br/>After getting comfortable with PHP which step am i going to take next?<br/>Your input will be highly appreciated sir.</div></div>

I once read that if you want to program for fun and make quick cash but not core programmer you do python, javascript and Go. They are like plug and play things if you are good. BUT. If you want to be a real programmer for business, career and make big cash in better company. They go for C++, Java and C#. The road is not easy but it pays well. Im just a starter that read so. Do you want quick job or you want the best?</div></div>
