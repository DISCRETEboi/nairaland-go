I forgot I bought groundnut earlier before I got to the mall. I kept it in my pocket and went ahead to get my stuff. After picking the items I needed. I went straight to the cashier's desk and joined the queue.  If you see the hot chicks that were behind me, even the cashier wasn’t left out in this contest of beauty.

queue said, “How fine boy go shook groundnut for pocket dey chop am like small pikin?” <br>I couldn't say anything, that day I wished everything could come to an end quickly because my ego has been
