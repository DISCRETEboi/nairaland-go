I'm always angry whenever I see posts like this one the OP made.<br><br>People just open their mouth and say all sort or rubbish about skill acquisition.<br>The problem is that we have an irresponsible, below-par people ruling us, people unfit for leadership. It is the Government responsibility to create jobs don't even think otherwise except you're also not intelligent like our leaders.<br><br>From my observation (no actual calculated statistics) it will take 30 graduates to have made it in life through jobs before 1 graduate to make it through all these skills you're shouting. (Nigeria's case is different, because we wan build house, drive fancy cars and do parties without investing in pensions.
